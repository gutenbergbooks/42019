<small>READY FOR THE START</small></h2>


<p>“What are we waiting for, Commodore Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m the last one to be in a hurry, boys,
but it seems to me we ought to be getting away.
The river ain’t waiting up for us, you notice.”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses, Buster, and count noses;
perhaps you’ll find that there are only five of us
present.”</p>

<p>“Huh! guess you’re right, Josh Purdue; but
what’s become of Jimmie. I never heard a
splash, and I don’t see him swimmin’, if he is
a regular water duck. Water’s too cold any
way, this fine April day, for goin’ in.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jack sent him back to the post office
to see if there was any mail. He’s thinking of
George here, who’s expecting a letter from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that sweet little Southern girl he met last fall,
when we were knocking around the Florida
Keys in our motor boats, after coming down
the coast.”</p>

<p>“Rats! speak for yourself, Josh!” exclaimed
the fifth member of the party, whose name
seemed to be George, and who was a nervous,
active boy, one of those kind who are always
wanting to do things in a hurry; “didn’t I see you
get a lavender colored letter only last week,
and when I walked past him purposely in the
post office, fellows, oh! my goodness! you
ought to have sniffed the lovely perfume that
oozed out of that envelope. Did Josh tear
the end off? Not that I could notice; but he
took out his knife, and cut it so carefully like,
you’d think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sure we’ve got all the grub aboard, Jack?”
asked the said Josh, who had turned more or
less red in the face with confusion at being so
unexpectedly attacked, “because it’d be a
mighty tough thing to get snugly settled in
the first camp of the season, and find you’ve
gone and left that elegant home-cured ham
to home.”</p>

<p>“Our ham’s safe, all right; I’m looking
right at it now!” declared George, as he stared
at the rosy face of Josh, and chuckled aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve gone over the list, and checked things
off, with the help of Herb here; and so far as
we could tell, there’s nothing missing. Things
seem to be in good shape, after lying all winter
in the boat-yard. And the engines work splendidly,”
was the report of the boy named Jack,
to whom the others seemed to look as though
he might have some right to that title of “Commodore,”
being the chief officer of the motor
boat club.</p>

<p>They were standing on the river bank just
below a small town that was situated on the
Upper Mississippi; and fastened to the shore
by stout cables were three power boats of vastly
different patterns.</p>

<p>One of them, owned by George Rollins, was
a speed boat, narrow of beam, and capable of
doing wonderful stunts in the way of annihilating
space, whenever the big powered motor
chose to act decently, which happened more
frequently in these days than in the past, when
it used to give the skipper much trouble. This
boat was known as a freak, and went under the
name of the Wireless.</p>

<p>The second was a good, roomy craft, which
George called a “punkin-seed,” because it took
up so much room. Herbert Dickson was the
satisfied owner of this boat, and as it bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
name of Comfort, it may readily be understood
that the captain was a quiet, unassuming lad,
who as a rule minded his own business, and always
wanted comfort before speed. Still, it
had often happened that Herb got to his destination
long before George, who spent so much
time tinkering with his balky engine, while that
of the roomy craft had never been known to act
sulky, or quit business, but worked right along
like a well-oiled clock.</p>

<p>The third boat was a happy medium between
the other two, and went under the name of the
Tramp. Jack Stormways held the wheel of
this, and as a rule the absent member, Jimmie
Brannagan, served as the crew. The Tramp
was a reliable article, and probably better fitted
for cruising than either of the others, when one
wanted an all-round craft, capable of speed,
and yet not cramped for room, or cranky in
action.</p>

<p>These six lads had formed a club, and during
the last two years had been able, by reason of
fortunate circumstances whereby they came
into a considerable sum of money, to make
several long cruises.</p>

<p>These have been narrated at length in previous
volumes of this Series, and the reader
of the present book, who has not had the pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of making the acquaintance of Jack and
his chums up to now, and would know more
about them, is referred to the earlier numbers
for full particulars, with the assurance that he
will find an abundance of lively reading there.</p>

<p>Their first cruise had been down the Father
of Waters all the way to New Orleans, where
they had a mission to perform. After that
they had the boats shipped to Clayton on the
St. Lawrence; and for the better part of vacation
time cruised among the Thousand Islands,
and on the Great Lakes, going up through the
wonderful Soo Canal, and seeing everything
that was worth while in that enchanted region.</p>

<p>Then, in the winter, they were given a
glorious chance to start down the Atlantic
coast, taking the inside route away from the
ocean, and reaching Florida after some of the
most stirring adventures ever told.</p>

<p>And as their time had not been exhausted,
they put in some weeks of pleasure in navigating
among the Keys of the Florida peninsula, meeting
with many stirring adventures, all of
which have been faithfully chronicled for the
reading of our boys.</p>

<p>And now, here were the Easter holidays
come, and a little river excursion planned,
down to a big island that lay some ninety miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
or more below the home town, and which was
an object of more or less curiosity to the passengers
on the river steamboats, because of the
strange stories that were told about mysterious
lights seen there, and queer noises that had been
heard from time to time.</p>

<p>Fishermen sometimes stopped there, in several
little old huts they had erected; but of late
years they seemed to have rather abandoned
the island for other more favored localities;
declaring that the fishing was no longer good
there, and all that; but it was secretly passed
around that they had been frightened off
through some means; and so the island had
come to have a bad name.</p>

<p>These bold lads liked nothing better than to
explore such a place, and learn for themselves
whether there was any truth in the wild stories
going around. There was always a sort of
peculiar fascination for them in exploding silly
stories about haunted houses, and mills, and
all such things. On several occasions Jack and
his five chums had just looked into such affairs,
and proved how foolish the talk had been.
And during the winter they had often talked
about Bedloe’s Island, and what people were
saying about it; until finally some one proposed
that when Easter came along, with more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
week of freedom from school duties, they take
a run down the river, and camp there; fish
and loaf, and just have the best possible time,
in spite of all the ghosts that ever rose up from
the grave when the solemn hour of midnight
came around.</p>

<p>And here they were, only waiting for the
return of Jimmie, when they meant to go
aboard, cast off the lines, float out upon the
swirling waters of the great river, and then
starting their engines, go speeding down the
current.</p>

<p>Although George, always in a hurry, might
be expected to show impatience, even stout
Buster, who was well named, had confessed
to a feeling of anxiety to get started. They
all loved this life on the water so much, that
after being shut up between the walls of the
high school building for some months now,
five days in a week, they were just wild to be
afloat.</p>

<p>“What d’ye suppose Clarence Macklin’d say
if he saw our bully little flotilla all ready, with
steam up, to start on this new voyage?” Buster
asked, a few minutes afterwards, as they
stood there, keeping an anxious eye toward
the border of the near-by town, and along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
river road which Jimmie would have to use
to reach them.</p>

<p>This same Clarence had always been a thorn
in the flesh of the motor boat boys ever since
the club was started. He had certain habits
that the others did not like, and when he applied
for admission, it was no surprise that he
had been black-balled.</p>

<p>After that Clarence, who was of a mean disposition,
could never forgive Jack and his
chums; and he had lost no opportunity to
annoy them, often going to extremes in his
desire to make them all the trouble that he could.</p>

<p>During their cruise down the Mississippi,
and when upon the St. Lawrence and the Great
Lakes he had bobbed up every little while,
with his fast boat, known under the name of
Flash, and there were times when Jack and
his friends just hated the sight of that contemptuous
face of Clarence Macklin.</p>

<p>So when Buster mentioned it now, the boys
looked at each other, with a little anxious expression
on their faces.</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess we needn’t look for any more
trouble from Clarence,” Jack remarked. “He’s
kept clear of us all winter, you know; and
perhaps he’s let the whole thing drop. I hope
so, anyway.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I know Clarence better than the rest
of you,” said Herb, “because I used to chum
with him before I found better fellows to go
with; and you can take it from me that when
he’s quiet, that’s the time he’s to be feared
most of all, for he’s sure to be hatching up mischief.
That brain of his is never still. And
ever since we got back from Florida he’s been
listening, second-hand, to the great stories we
had to tell, and just eating his heart out with
envy because he couldn’t have been there too.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Josh Purdue, with a frown,
for he had had many unpleasant experiences
with the said Clarence, and the mention of that
name acted on him as a red flag would on a
bull; “and I happen to know that Bully Joe,
the feller Clarence still hangs on to for his crony,
heard me tell a gentleman about the trip we
expected to take during Easter holidays; and
when I saw him running down the street so fast
you could a-played marbles on his coat-tail,
I just knew he was in the biggest hurry ever
to tell Clarence all about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then that explains why you’ve been
keeping an eye out on the river so much all
the time we’ve been standing here,” remarked
Jack. “Now, I thought you were only trying
to figure on the strength of the current, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
long it ought to take us to drop down to Bedloe’s
Island.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be there before the sun drops out of
sight; that is, wind and weather, and the engine
of the Wireless permitting,” said Josh.</p>

<p>“Now, never you mind about what my motor
is going to do,” spoke up George, who, in spite
of all the tricks that had been played on him
by his balky engine, still had an abiding faith
in its ability to do wonders, and was always
sure he had solved the combination that had
been bothering him, this time for good. “I’ve
been working a whole lot on that same machine
since our last cruise down among the oyster
reefs of Florida, and I’m dead sure I’ve got it
fixed now so that she’ll never go back on me
again. P’raps she won’t be quite as swift
as before, but then I’m coming to the conclusion
that speed ain’t everything when you’re
on a long trip. You fellows used to take it
so comfy, while I was always fretting, and
worrying over my motive power.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” exclaimed Jack, “the old
buccaneer has seen a great light, and is half
converted right now. Chances are, Herb, he’ll
be offering to trade with you before long.”</p>

<p>At that George looked daggers at the Comfort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
riding like a contented duck on the water
near by.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may, when I want a tub,” he
said, severely; “but I don’t think that day’ll
ever arrive, Jack.”</p>

<p>“All the same,” spoke up Josh, who had
often been Herb’s companion on the beamy
boat, and knew the luxury of having plenty of
room, without being told a thousand times to
keep still, because he was rocking the boat;
“I can remember the time when you were
mighty glad to come aboard that same tub, and
beg a breakfast from the skipper, because your
silly cranky Wireless was out of commission or
sunk. Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth,
George. Time may come again when you’ll
feel like begging the pardon of that noble craft.
Many’s the happy day I’ve had while serving
my time on her. She’s a dandy, that’s what.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Josh!” said Herb, quietly; but
there was a satisfied gleam in his eyes that
spoke louder than words; for Herb really loved
his boat, and took it to heart more than easy-going,
reckless George imagined, when the
scornful member of the club chose to speak
slightingly of her.</p>

<p>Possibly George felt twinges of remorse, as
his memory carried him back to certain occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in the adventurous past; for he tossed his
head, and went on to say:</p>

<p>“Oh! she’s all right, for those who don’t
care anything about getting along in a rush;
but you know I never could stand that sort of
thing. I’m too much a bundle of nerves.
When I’ve set my mind on doing a thing I
don’t like to be kept waiting. Herb wouldn’t
fancy my boat any more’n I do his; and there
you are.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll soon be off now,” remarked
Buster, joyfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, because there comes Jimmie,” added
Jack.</p>

<p>Jimmie Brannagan was an Irish boy, as his
name announced. He was a sort of ward of
Jack’s father, who held some little money in
trust until the lad came of age. His parents
had been of a good family, and while Jimmie
chose to talk in a species of brogue, that was
amusing to his mates, he could really use as
good language as any fellow, if he chose
to exert himself. He lived with the Stormways,
and was much in the company of Jack,
being a warm-hearted boy, impulsive, and a
friend who would stick through thick and thin.</p>

<p>He was seen to be half running along the
road, as though eager to join his comrades,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and get started on the joyous trip; for Jimmy
was as happy as a bird when aboard a boat.
As a rule he acted as Jack’s team-mate; but
there were times when changes in the crews
had to be made, owing to a disinclination on
the part of Buster, Jimmy, and Josh to serve
any great length of time aboard the wobbly
Wireless; for they declared that the narrow
boat was just about as nervous as its skipper,
and kept the crew on edge all the time.</p>

<p>“What’s he waving that newspaper for,
d’ye think?” Buster asked, presently.</p>

<p>“You might guess a thousand years, and
never know,” remarked George, “but he’ll be
along right soon now, and then we’ll find out.
Take a sprint, Jimmie; stretch a single into a
two-bagger, and slide for second! Here you
come, old top! Now, what’s all the row about;
tell us?”</p>

<p>Jimmie, red-faced, freckled, good-natured Jimmie,
grinned, and held out the open newspaper
toward them.</p>

<p>“Sure and they do be havin’ the dickens av
a time up beyant us. Look at the illegant
head-lines, would ye? ‘Bowld robbery! Thaves
break into the Bank, and loot the Safe av a
Forchune! Lawrence all excited over the visit
av yeggmen! Reward offered for tha apprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
av the Rascals.’ Whoop! now, don’t
that sound loike another time when we was
sthartin’ down the river. History, begorra,
does love to repate itsilf. But for the love av
goodness lit’s get off. I’m that ager to feel
the water gurgling underneath the keel av a
boat, I could straddle a log, and take me chances
av a cruise down the ould river. Jack, darlint,
give the worrd!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE CRUISE BEGUN</small></h2>


<p>“All aboard!” sang out Jack, as he thrust
the paper containing such sensational news
into his pocket, to be glanced over at some
more convenient season, and little suspecting
how it would enter into the fortunes of the party
of fun-loving boys while on their Easter holidays’
cruise.</p>

<p>Everybody immediately seemed to be in
motion, and the way in which the various crews
stood by to cast off hawsers, while the skippers
looked to their engines, was well worth seeing.</p>

<p>“Let go!” called the commodore of the boat
club, when he saw that everything was ready.</p>

<p>The ropes were unfastened, and the three
lads sprang aboard, just as the current began
to grip each boat, and cause it to slowly start
upon the new voyage that appeared so mild
in the beginning, yet which was destined to be
written down as one of the most adventurous
of all those the six boys had enjoyed.</p>

<p>“Whoop! we’re off!” yelled Buster, as he
scrambled on board the Wireless, in his usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
clumsy way, that brought a word of warning
from George, and caused the boat to careen badly.</p>

<p>“You will be off, if you try that sort of racket
many times,” declared the skipper. “What
d’ye take this racer for, a canalboat? Be more
careful Buster, how you lounge around. I
guess they nicknamed you right when they called
you Hippopotamus, Pudding, and all that sort.
Now, sit down exactly in the middle, and when
you do have to move, be careful not to shift your
weight too sudden-like. No boat can do its
prettiest when it isn’t on an even keel.”</p>

<p>“Say, is my hair parted exactly in the middle,
George? If it ain’t, please let me get it straight
before you start!” observed the fat boy, with
a touch of satire in his voice, something Buster
seldom indulged in; but he had sailed the
stormy seas with George before and could look
back to many a sad time aboard that most uncomfortable
Wireless; still the three fellows
had drawn lots to see who would have to stand
for the agony on this new cruise, and it had
fallen to poor Buster to play the part of victim.</p>

<p>George did not reply to this shot. He was
busy with his engine, and both the other boats
were already moving off, with the rapid popping
of their exhausts announcing that everything
was working in apple-pie order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Please don’t tell me that we’re all up the
flue, even before we get started, George?”
pleaded Buster, turning pale with apprehension.</p>

<p>“Keep still, won’t you, Buster; you bother
me,” replied the other, still working at his
engine. “It’s only a little thing, that don’t
matter much. And you see, it gives us a
chance to let the others get a lead. You know
how much I like to come up from behind, and
rush ahead? Well, that’s what we’re going
to do now. Be a sport, Buster, and don’t whine
so much. Everything’s going to be lovely,
and the goose will hang high, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“I guess it will,” sighed the fat boy, with a
resigned expression on his face, as though he
realized that he was in for it, and might as
well make the best of a bad bargain.</p>

<p>The boat was floating down the current, as
Buster had pushed out from the shore with a
pole, after getting aboard. The other craft
had gotten some little distance away, and doubtless
those on board were indulging in the usual
“I told you so’s” that accompanied every mishap
on the part of the Wireless, for both Jimmie
and Josh could be seen looking back, and
even waving their hands, as though saying
good-bye.</p>

<p>Then all at once there came a quick series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of sharp sounds, and George looked up with a
proud expression on his face, as the little power-boat
began to rush through the water at racehorse
speed.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you, Buster?” he observed,
as he clutched the wheel, and turned the boat’s
head in a direct line with the others of the little
fleet; “and after this, please don’t act so impatient.
Leave it all to me. An engine’s a
delicate thing to handle, and as full of whims
as a girl. Even the weather affects them at
times; and they just have to be coaxed, and
led along. But I flatter myself I’ve got this
thing down fine, now, and we won’t have any
trouble with it on this trip, while I cut circles
around the other fellows.”</p>

<p>That was a pet hobby with George, making
speed, and “running rings” around his comrades.
Nothing tickled him more than to be
able to do this, even though it failed to bother
Jack or Herb in the least.</p>

<p>“Mebbe you’re right, George,” replied Buster,
meekly, “you see, when it comes to mechanics
my education has been sadly neglected,
and I couldn’t run an engine if my very life
depended on it. All I’ve noticed is, that the
other motors don’t seem to bother about
weather, or any old thing. They go plodding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
right along like they had business to do, and
didn’t mean to be halted.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, Buster,” remarked the other
eagerly, “they never have troubles of their own
because they’re slow-pokes, like heavy farm
horses. It’s the highly bred racer that’s all
nerves, you know. But look at us eating up
space, will you? Don’t we fly along, though?
This is what I like, Buster. What are you
looking at me that way for?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m going to sneeze, George, and
I hope it won’t&mdash;ker-chew! oh! my, it’s coming
again, ker-chew! Excuse me, George. I’ll try
and not let that happen often, if I can help it.”</p>

<p>George looked at his companion rather suspiciously.
He could not tell whether Buster
really meant what he said, or was speaking in
irony. But the gallant way in which the narrow
boat was cutting the water gripped his attention
again, and after that he could not bother himself
with minor things.</p>

<p>They soon overtook the other two boats
moving along in company. Jack could have
easily gone ahead of the beamy Comfort had
he wished, but he preferred to stay by Herb,
so that the crews could exchange opinions from
time to time. In his mind a large part of the
pleasure to be gotten out of cruising came from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
this sociability; whereas George would be rushing
off by himself, satisfied if only he could
make a mile in a fraction less time than at any
previous time.</p>

<p>In ten minutes George was far ahead, and
making the water fly out on either side as he
urged his engine on to do its prettiest.</p>

<p>“Up to his old tricks again,” remarked Josh,
as he tidied up a little aboard the Tramp,
secretly delighted that luck had given him a
berth with the commodore, whom he admired
greatly.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you expect?” replied Jack,
who was taking things easy, with his engine
working like a charm, “what’s bred in the bone
can never be beaten out of the flesh, they say;
and George, with his nervous ways, cares only
for racing, whenever he can coax anybody to
give him a go. But mark what I say, Josh,
it’s only a question of time before he rubs up
against his old motor troubles again. He’s
never satisfied when he’s got the thing running
smoothly, but has to go tinkering at it to see
if he can’t get another fraction of speed out,
and then all at once it balks, and refuses to work
at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Josh, with a wide grin,
“we may be towing the Wireless back home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
yet; and it wouldn’t be the first time, either,
Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well, hardly,” mused the skipper, smiling
himself as memory carried him back to other
scenes connected with their numerous cruises
in these same boats.</p>

<p>“Does George know that we expect to tie
up at noon, and have a bite ashore; or will he
be silly enough to want to rush along that way,
and get to the island long before we think of
pulling in there?” Josh went on to ask.</p>

<p>“He knows our plans all right,” answered
the other, “though you can never tell what
George will do, he’s so full of notions. But as
stuff to eat is aboard the roomy Comfort, and
we’re carrying the rest, unless he wants to
starve poor old Buster, so as to cut down his
weight, and make less ballast for the speed-boat
to carry, I guess he’ll haul in about eleven
and wait for us.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t envy Buster his job of holding
down that bucking broncho of a Wireless,”
Josh chuckled. “I c’n see him right now, sitting
there, holding on, and looking like he was tryin’
to accommodate his breathin’ with the panting
of the engine, while George he looks daggers
every time Buster gulps in a wad of air at the
wrong time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! come now, Josh, it isn’t quite so bad
as all that,” declared Jack, with a shake of his
head. “And even George couldn’t keep Buster
from having his own way, once he gets started.
It’s good he learned how to swim long ago,
because chances are, he’ll be overboard more
than once before this voyage is done.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe George’ll throw him over, when
he gets nervous, and Buster keeps wobbling
around, making the boat roll to beat the band,
eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know how that is yourself, because
that’s what happened when you had the
job of crew aboard his boat,” the skipper of the
Tramp went on to say; which reminder seemed
to afford Josh considerable amusement, to
judge from his laughter.</p>

<p>They went on steadily, putting mile after
mile behind them. Now and then some river
craft was encountered, though these were of
course not near so numerous as would have been
the case below the confluence of the Missouri
and Ohio with the Father of Waters. Sometimes
it was a steamboat that was breasting
the current; or it might be a plodding towboat,
with a barge or two alongside. And then again
they overtook a queer looking shantyboat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which had the appearance, with its cabin, of
a cheese box on a raft.</p>

<p>All these familiar sights were eagerly observed
by Jack and his companion, as well as the two
upon the other boat, for they recalled pleasant
memories.</p>

<p>George had gone so far ahead that his little
boat looked like a dot upon the water; but possibly
he would remember in time that he had no
means of satisfying hunger aboard the Wireless,
and might anchor to await their coming, giving
Buster a chance to wet a line, for the fat boy
had taken a great fancy for fishing, and was
always complaining that he did not get half
the opportunities to indulge in his favorite
sport that he would like.</p>

<p>Now and then they would pass a town upon
either shore of the river, although as a rule
these were not so plentiful in this section, where
the banks were inclined to be marshy.</p>

<p>The morning was gradually wearing away,
and everything seemed to be going smoothly.
Josh expressed himself as surprised that hours
had passed, and still the nettlesome speed-boat
continued to keep going along, as though George
had indeed finally mastered the secret of its
precious unreliable behavior.</p>

<p>“But when George is around, you c’n expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
any old thing to happen,” he wound up with,
“and even when things are working smoothly,
he won’t be satisfied till he upsets the combination
again, you see if it ain’t so.”</p>

<p>Jack did not attempt to contradict his prediction,
because he also knew George like a book
and thought pretty much the same way.</p>

<p>Just about eleven, Josh declared that they
seemed to be gradually getting nearer the pilot
boat of the party, as George liked to have his
craft called; though for that part he would
have made a most unreliable guide, and had
the others chosen to follow him, they would
have been led into many more messes than
actually fell to their lot.</p>

<p>“That’s because Buster has rebelled,” Jack
observed, “there’s been a mutiny aboard that
craft; and George had been told that for one
Buster doesn’t mean to miss his lunch at noon,
just because the Wireless is making a record
run.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you mean they’ve thrown the old
mud hook over, and are waiting for us slow-pokes
to come along, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Just about that; but we’re getting all the
fun we want out of making slower time; and
our engines won’t go back on us either, in
spite,” laughed the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, while we’re gliding along in this fine
way&mdash;I always like to use that word when
speaking of cruising, it sounds so fine&mdash;I’ll
be getting up the menu for our first dinner
ashore. It makes my mouth water just to
think of a campfire again, after all that time.
Brought your little old Marlin along, didn’t
you, Jack? P’raps we might get a few late
ducks while we’re out, if all of ’em ain’t gone
north by now. And if Buster only does his
duty, and grabs up a fish now and then, why,
it’ll be just great.”</p>

<p>So Josh, who used to be something of a cook
in times past, amused himself in a way that
suited his fancy, while they drew closer and
closer to the place where the speed-boat awaited
them.</p>

<p>George was full of boasting as usual, and
predicted a record run for his craft. None of
the others disputed his assertions, but they
exchanged looks, for they had heard all this
sort of talk before, and then seen poor disappointed
George only too glad to take a tow in
the end, with his engine stubborn, or broken
down.</p>

<p>Together they continued on down the river;
where they could readily tie to the bank, and
go ashore to cook dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a great deal of climbing back and
forth, and everybody but George seemed bustling
with business; he sat there, and pottered
with his engine, as though some new idea had
seized hold of him, and he meant to try one of
his everlasting experiments that always ended
so disastrously.</p>

<p>Then the voice of Buster was heard in the
land, lamenting.</p>

<p>“It was there yesterday, because I put it in
away with my own hands; and George here
says he never opened that locker once; but
now that I want to put it on, my new sweater
has disappeared the funniest way ever. I
wouldn’t be surprised, fellers, if we found that
some thief got aboard our boats last night, and
couldn’t resist taking that bully sweater with
the red moon on the front; and that’s what!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>BUSTER CAPTURES A FISH</small></h2>


<p>“Chances are you left it behind in the shed
where the boats were kept,” George remarked,
looking up from his work, “but I wish you’d just
step ashore, and let me go on with my little
job here, Buster. Excuse me for saying it,
but whenever you swing around it makes the
boat rock just awful.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m a-goin’ right away, George, and
only too glad for a chance to set foot again on
something solid, that won’t sway every time I
breathe wrong. Wait till I get my fish lines,
will you? P’raps if I can’t have the pleasure
of wearing my new sweater, I might manage
to pick up a few small finny denizens of the
mighty Mississippi. And when it comes to
<em>fish</em>, I know you fellows are fond of most any
kind that swims.”</p>

<p>“Except dog-fish; I draw the line there,”
objected Josh. “But here’s some meat to
bait your line with, Buster; you see, Jack
brought a steak along, thinking we’d miss it
all of a sudden; and we’re going to fry some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
onions with that. Makes your mouth water,
don’t it?”</p>

<p>“Makes me eyes run a-peelin’ these same
onions!” groaned Jimmie; “somebody please
do be koind enough to take out me hanky,
and woipe me tears away. ’Tis remimberin’
me ould grandmither I am at this blissed minute
and that’s what makes me cry.”</p>

<p>Buster kindly performed that brotherly duty,
and then busied himself with his fish lines.
Rod or pole he had none, nor did Buster ever
bother with such a thing as a reel. A large
hook, with a hunk of meat fastened to it, and
dropped overboard, suited his ideas all right;
after which he trusted to luck to bring him a
capture.</p>

<p>The fire was started by Jack, and already
Josh could be seen getting ready to serve as
chef. He had fetched along a cute little white
cap without a peak, which he donned whenever
he had to serve as the “dish-slinger and pot
wrestler,” as he was fond of calling his occupation.
It was intended to stand for his badge of
authority; and when he had it on, the rest were
supposed to be his willing slaves, ready to
jump at his bidding.</p>

<p>There is no part of an outing that suits boys
better than preparing meals, unless it is in disposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the same after they are cooked. With
appetites whetted to a keen edge by the air,
and freedom from anxiety, they can hardly
wait until called to the feast, but wander around,
begging the cook to please hurry, if he does not
want to have a funeral on his hands.</p>

<p>There was always more or less merry talk
passing back and forth while these six comrades
tried and true, got dinner ready; for they were
a good-natured lot, and very fond of each other,
despite frequent bickerings, usually between
George on the one hand, and some chum on the
other.</p>

<p>Buster had managed to set his two lines, as
best the conditions allowed. Since George was
so touchy about his rocking the narrow boat with
his clumsy movements, Buster had gone out to
the beamy Comfort, and fastened one of his
stout lines to a cleat he found handy. The
other he had thrown out from the shore above,
and tied to a stake driven into the earth, just
as he had seen a snubbing-post used down in
Florida, when sharks were being fished for
around the inlets.</p>

<p>Every little while he would glance toward
these lines, having arranged so that if a fish
took hold, a little piece of white rag would be
hoisted as a signal; very much on the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that frequently used by pickerel fishermen,
when watching a dozen or two holes cut through
the ice, each with its separate line.</p>

<p>The cooking progressed slowly. Josh said
he was out of practice, but that when he got
his hand in, all would be smooth sailing again.</p>

<p>He had plenty of assistance, for every one
but George and Buster hung around, ready
to lend a hand; and after he had fixed his
snares with the baited hooks at the end, even
the fat boy was willing to do anything Josh
asked.</p>

<p>Finally the cook announced that everything
was ready, and that they could draw up to the
board. Of course this latter was only a figure
of speech, for there was not a sign of a board
around; the things were placed right on the
ground, while the diners were expected to get
their supplies on a tin platter, and in a tin cup;
after which they were at liberty to squat like
tailors, with their legs drawn up under them;
or else retreat to the boats for more comfortable
seats.</p>

<p>“Talk to me about your banquets,” remarked
Herb, as he started in on his rasher of
steak and fried onions, “this beats anything
that was ever invented. I wouldn’t change
places with a king, right now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Them’s my sintimints!” echoed Jimmie,
as well as a fellow could who had his mouth
crammed full at the moment, so that he had to
talk from one side.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, George, or you’ll get left!” called
Josh, noticing that the skipper of the speed boat
had not come ashore.</p>

<p>“Oh! I suppose I’ll just have to, but I’d rather
be left to work here,” replied George, nervously,
whereat the rest glanced at each other, and the
looks thus exchanged seemed to say as plainly
as anything: “Wonder now if he’s gone and
done it, mixed things up with his cranky old
engine, and don’t seem able to get it to working
right again; that would be just like Fussy
George!”</p>

<p>It was more than pleasant to sit there, looking
out upon the broad river and enjoying the feast
that had been prepared as a starter to their
camp life. The very wind that came sweeping
across from the further shore, cool and delicious,
seemed to be of a different brand to any that
they enjoyed at home; so much do surroundings
have to do with things.</p>

<p>No one seemed in any particular hurry but
George, who bolted his dinner, and was back
again on his boat long before any of the others
had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are we nearly half way there, do you think
Jack?” asked Herb, who knew that the skipper
of the Tramp kept track of all these things
and had charts as well of the river.</p>

<p>“We’ve come forty-five miles since starting,
because, you see, the current is pretty strong;
and for once we haven’t been held up by
George’s cranky boat,” replied Jack, lowering
his voice a little when saying this last, since
there was no necessity for offending the chum
whose little oddities gave them more or less
fun during a cruise.</p>

<p>“Then that would mean we’ve still got a good
fifty to go,” suggested Buster.</p>

<p>“Somebody get a leather medal for Buster
here, our Lightning Calculator. Now, it would
take me ever so long to figure that forty-five
from ninety-five really leaves fifty; but just
see how he grabs the answer right off the reel.
It won’t be long before he has a little ‘Professor’
tacked to his name,” and Josh chuckled as
though he had really said something smart.</p>

<p>Buster did not seem to feel hurt; in fact,
many of these little shafts just glanced from
him as arrows might from the thick hide of a
rhinoceros; which is not saying that Buster
was impervious to ridicule, for that would be
far from the truth, as he could be quite sensitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
at times; but Josh he treated with supreme
contempt whenever the latter tried to be funny
at his expense.</p>

<p>All this while Buster had tried to keep one
eye on the places where his fishing lines were
out. He fancied several times that he saw
a white rag start to show, but before he could
scramble to his feet, which was quite an effort
for him, it was all over, and proved to be only
a nibble, so that on each occasion he had to sink
back again, and have patience.</p>

<p>There were good fish in the old Mississippi,
and he knew it, so why should he not have his
share of the spoils? In his moments of leisure,
while preparing his hooks and lines, no doubt
Buster had pictured himself as hauling in some
monster that would be the envy of all his camp-mates;
and beside which he must have his
picture taken, as positive proof that he was
the successful angler.</p>

<p>Jack knew that once they started they would
be apt to make their destination in less than
five hours; so that there was no need of haste.
He had seen much of George’s hurrying, and
what grievous results it often brought in its
train, that somehow he felt more averse to
making haste than ever.</p>

<p>So he and Herb and Andy sat there, chatting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
as they finished their dinner, with Buster squatting
alongside like a great toad, waiting for that
bite which did not seem to materialize very fast,
and in a sort of hazy way listening to what was
said by his three chums; Josh being busy with
the cooking utensils, which he liked to keep as
clean as sand and water could scour them, after
the most approved camp methods known.</p>

<p>All at once there was a heave on the part of
Buster; who seemed to be actuated by some
wild impulse, for he made frantic efforts to get
up; but as he had been sitting on one of his
legs, it had gone to “sleep,” so that even after
the fat boy did succeed in gaining an erect
position, he came very near falling over into
the fire that was still smouldering.</p>

<p>“Hi! what’s all this mean; got a fit, Pudding?”
shouted the alarmed Josh, as he supported
the swaying form of the other for just
five seconds; when Buster broke loose, and went
limping toward the river, uttering all sorts of
vaporings, in his excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s only a fish, after all,” grunted
Josh, who had begun to believe that there was
something tremendous the matter.</p>

<p>But at any rate it meant a whole lot for Buster,
who, scrambling aboard the Comfort made a
bee line for the spot where he had fastened his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
stout cord. Sure enough the piece of white
rag was fluttering from the top of the rudder
post, having been pulled up there when the
fish had seized the bait, and started away with
it.</p>

<p>Everybody just naturally stopped whatever
they were doing at the time, to watch the fisherman.
Even George poked his head up to see
what all the row was about, and for the moment
forgot his troubles with that cranky engine.</p>

<p>Buster was giving little cries of mingled delight
and wonder.</p>

<p>“Wow! it’s sure a big one this time, boys!
Takes your Uncle Nick to coax the dandies to
take hold. Yes, I spit on my bait every time,
and that’s the trick to fetch ’em. That’ll do,
Josh, I’m running this circus, and I’d thank you
not to butt in. Watch me land him now, boys!
Say, ain’t this fun, though? Worth while coming
fifty miles to see me do the great act. Wow!”</p>

<p>“Look out, Bumpus, or he’ll pull you in!”
called Jack; but evidently the warning meant
in good earnest, fell on deaf ears. Bumpus
was not going to be denied the pleasure of landing
his own capture.</p>

<p>They saw him unfasten the cord with trembling
hands, hardly able to contain himself.
Then he threw himself back in a noble attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
that made Josh compare him with “Ajax defying
the lightning,” which every one has seen
in marble.</p>

<p>All at once Herb gave a shout that was echoed
by others.</p>

<p>“Whip the cord around the cleat again,
Buster, quick!”</p>

<p>Buster attempted to obey, realizing when it
was too late that he had cut off more than he
could manage when he tried to land that monster
fish; but unable to do so, and unwilling to
let go of the line, for he had a very stubborn
nature, the next thing they knew there was a
great splash, and Buster was wallowing in the
yellow waters of the Mississippi.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>A MYSTERY LOOMS UP</small></h2>


<p>That was not the first time Buster Longfellow
had taken an involuntary bath in the Father
of Waters, as his comrades knew only too well.
At the same time, this fact did not lessen the
excitement that followed his disappearance
one little atom.</p>

<p>Such a splashing and grunting and wallowing
as there was when the fat boy took that sudden
plunge; why, one could easily imagine a whole
troop of hogs had been coaxed in to being
scrubbed, preparatory to an exhibition at the
county fair.</p>

<p>And the way the water flew was a caution. A
young whale working its way up the river from
the gulf, or rather a porpoise, since whales are
not to be found often in the Sunny South,
could not have created a greater racket.</p>

<p>Of course every fellow, after that first shock,
sprang to his feet, and made for the shore as
fast as his legs could carry him. It might be a
ludicrous sight, all very well, but there was a
little element of danger connected with it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they were comrades true, who could not stand
by, and see poor Buster dragged out into the
middle of the river by a fish.</p>

<p>When the splashing had in a measure subsided,
they discovered the stout figure of Buster.
He was standing in the yellow water up to his
waist and tugging with all his might at the fish
line, which he seemed to have wrapped around
both hands, as though just determined that his
prize should not get away.</p>

<p>Now the boy would gain a foot, and seem to be
dragging his capture toward land; when there
would be a sudden tremendous effort on the
part of the fish to escape, and the first thing
Buster knew, he was being pulled back again,
though he fought tooth and nail to hold his own.</p>

<p>Once his feet flew from under him, owing to
the slippery condition of the mud on which he
stood. At that a great “Oh!” broke out from
the other five boys; and Jack, who had been
hastily removing some of his outer garments,
with the intention of being ready in case his help
was needed, was just on the point of jumping
in, when Buster again emerged from the turmoil,
rising up like a Neptune, the water pouring
from his head like a young Niagara.</p>

<p>“Let him go, Buster; he’s too much for you!”
shrilled George, who was leaning over the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of his boat with a pole in his hand, and regardless
for once that the cranky Wireless careened far
down until her beam end almost took in water.</p>

<p>“I won’t!” snapped back the stubborn Buster,
shaking the drops from his face, as a New
Foundland dog might after a bath. “He’s
mine, and I’m going to grab him if it takes all
summer, see?”</p>

<p>He had managed to get a good footing once
more, and started to tug manfully with the result
that he immediately gained several yards. This
was the best he had done as yet, and in consequence
he seemed to receive inspiration to make
a still greater exertion.</p>

<p>After that the victory was as good as won.</p>

<p>Buster marched out on the bank the line over
his shoulder; and as soon as they could do so
without wetting themselves Josh and Herb
seized hold of the stout cord.</p>

<p>“Wow! it sure is a whale!” exclaimed George,
from his position of vantage on board his boat,
as something that flapped, and made a tremendous
splutter, was dragged out of the river,
and up on the shore.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous yellow catfish, one of
that species that help to make the Mississippi
famous among market fishermen.</p>

<p>“Whee! must weigh about as much as Buster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
does, and that’s a fact!” remarked Josh, as he
surveyed the monster.</p>

<p>It was not a lovely spectacle, with its slippery
skin, and great gaping mouth resembling that of
a big bulldog.</p>

<p>“What whiskers it’s got, the omadhaun!”
Jimmie called out, “and say the horn on his back,
wud yees? Whoo! but ’tis a brave lad ye arre,
Buster, to holdt sich a monster stiddy, and
walk ashore wid the same. I take off me hat
till yees, so I do, me laddybuck!”</p>

<p>Buster was panting like anything, and could
hardly get his breath; but Jack believed he had
never seen him look quite so happy, as when he
stood over that giant Mississippi cat, and had
his picture snapped off by George, who got his
new kodak out especially to preserve the incident
among the annals of the club.</p>

<p>“Get some dry clothes on you in a hurry,
Buster,” suggested Jack, after they had all
congratulated the hero of the occasion on his
dogged pluck, “it’s all very well holding on
like that, but you ought to know when it’s
time to let go, too. I thought that time had
come when it pulled you under. You had the
cord wrapped around both hands, Buster, a
very foolish thing to do, I think. If you hadn’t
been able to get your footing again, and had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
friends near by to lend a hand, it was apt to go
hard with you. And let me tell you there have
been more fishermen than a few drowned by
just such a foolish trick as that. Hold on as
long as you want, but never put yourself in a
position where you can’t let go.”</p>

<p>Buster smilingly agreed that this was good
advice, and promised to remember. He was
feeling so remarkably happy over his great
luck that he could not have taken offense at
anything, and would have made the rashest
sort of promises.</p>

<p>And while he rooted out his clothes bag, so
as to get some dry togs, Jack and Andy proceeded
to cut up the big fish; because they knew
that, horrible looking though the creature
might be to a sportsman, its flesh is highly esteemed
as an article of food along the length
of the whole river.</p>

<p>It was no easy task they had set themselves;
and more than once they wished the slippery
catfish had broken loose, and gone off with
Buster’s hook dangling from its jaw like cheap
jewelry, with which to dazzle its fellows. But
in the end they managed to secure all the meat
they wanted, and tossed the balance into the
river to feed its kind.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s be getting off!” called out Jack,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
after he had washed up, and in some measure
removed the fishy smell from his hands.</p>

<p>Since the other boys had taken everything
aboard, there was really nothing to detain
them; and presently the merry reports from
the various engines told that the three motorboats
had again resumed their journey down
the Mississippi in the direction of Bedloe’s
Island.</p>

<p>That was an afternoon not soon to be forgotten
by any of them, for the air was just
warm enough to make them delight in lying
around, and taking a sun bath. No doubt
George was having the time of his life with
Buster, who must be so chock full of his recent
triumph that every little while he would burst
out with a new string of questions concerning
his battle, and wishing to know what it looked
like from every angle ashore.</p>

<p>But the time passed, and as George’s engine
gave him no new trouble, the little flotilla made
splendid progress while the hours crept on.</p>

<p>At just three-forty-seven Jack gave a blast
from his old conch shell horn which he had
brought up from Florida with him&mdash;in fact,
every boat was provided with a similar means
for exchanging signals, and the boys had arranged
a regular code, so that when separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
by a mile or so they could talk with each other
after some sort of fashion.</p>

<p>This single blast just now announced that
Jack believed he had sighted the island that
was to be their destination, away down the
river. Judging from their speed, aided by the
swift current, they ought to make it inside of
another half hour. This would give them plenty
of time to hunt a good landing place, where they
could put up their tent, and make things at
least half way comfortable before night set in.</p>

<p>Although the boys could sleep aboard, and
very comfortable too, they preferred being
ashore whenever it was possible, all save George,
who could seldom be coaxed to desert his beloved
Wireless craft, even for a brief time. He
acted as though he dreaded lest that engine
think up some new trick if he left it alone;
eternal watchfulness was the price of victory
with George; and his chums often declared
that when he was on a cruise George hardly
knew what sort of country he passed through,
for keeping his nose down so persistently over
that motor of his.</p>

<p>Jack’s prediction came true, and when a
quarter after four came around, they were running
along the shore of a wooded island which
he announced was the object of their search.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where are we going to land, Jack?” called
out Buster, for the three boats were now very
close together, and the crews had been exchanging
comments on the sombre appearance of the
lonely island for some time past.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” came the answer, “because
I’ve never been here before. We’d better just
float along down close to the shore, and keep
an eye out for a suitable landing place. If we
don’t find one on this side, by the time we get
to the foot of the island, why, what’s to hinder
our working along up the other shore, and looking
for it there?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jack!” admitted Buster, who
was in one of his finest humors; though for
that matter they seldom knew the fat boy to
be anything but amiable and good-natured, as
most of his kind are.</p>

<p>They must have passed almost to the very
tail end of the long island when Josh let out a
whoop, and called the attention of his comrades
to what seemed to be a little bay that formed
a tiny cove, with a sandy beach beyond.</p>

<p>“Just the ticket!” agreed Jack, “looks like
it had been scooped out for a landing place.”</p>

<p>“Bet you them fishermen come right in; and
we’ll be apt to find some of their huts around
back there,” suggested George, who had possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
heard more stories about mysterious
Bedloe’s Island than any of the others, for he
had been making poor Buster’s flesh run cold
during the afternoon with accounts of strange
things people said had occurred to make the
place shunned.</p>

<p>“Then there must be good fishing around
here,” remarked Buster, with the air of one
who ought to be consulted whenever such sport
were mentioned, because he had surely won his
spurs that day, if any one ever did.</p>

<p>“Listen to him talk,” broke out Josh. “Now
he’s got the fishing bee on his brain and he’ll
just as like as not be at it morning, noon and
night, till we get sick of the smell of fish.
One good thing about it that I can see is, after
he’s been living on fish food for a whole week
Buster will have brains enough to last him all
summer, because they say it makes ’em, you
know. Sometimes I think he’s a little short
in his supply, especially when he wraps a fish
line around both hands, when he’s got a young
whale at the other end.”</p>

<p>They had no difficulty in passing into the
little “bight,” as Jack called the miniature cove,
for the water was deep enough for even the
Wireless; although Jack said they would have
to be sure and constantly keep tabs on whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the river was rising or falling each day and night,
since it would be mighty unpleasant to awaken
some fine morning to discover that their motor
boats were high and dry; as the water had gone
down a foot while they slept.</p>

<p>They secured the craft ashore to trees that
chanced to be growing close by; for floods did
not often come to this upper part of the great
river as they did below the confluence with the
Ohio and the Missouri.</p>

<p>Then some of the things were taken to land;
and the six boys were soon working like so many
beaver, fixing camp.</p>

<p>The tent had to be erected; and after it had
been partly placed in position a better spot was
discovered, so that the job had to be all done
over. As the day was growing near its close
and darkness might be expected to fall upon
them before another hour, there was no time for
loitering. Why, even George had been made
to see the error of his ways, and forgot all about
that everlasting motor of his for a short time,
lending a hand to get things in shape around the
camp.</p>

<p>Josh had plenty to do starting the fire, after
fashioning a rude but effective cooking range
out of the many stones that could be had along
the shore for the picking up. They carried a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
little contrivance that was very effective, being
a sort of spider or gridiron patterned after the
shelf in most kitchen ranges. Jack had had it
made by the local blacksmith, and when it was
laid across two ridges of rock, between which
the red coals lay, they could place the coffee-pot,
a skillet and even a kettle on the bars at
the same time, without the constant danger of
upsetting that always exists where a camper
tries to cook with only a resting place of stones
for his various utensils.</p>

<p>The others were busy at various duties when
Josh was heard calling out, with a touch of
authority in his voice, as became the chef, now
placed in supreme command by reason of his
exalted and important office.</p>

<p>“Whoever took that grub I left over here by
the tree, better bring it back again right away,
and quit meddlin’ if he wants me to exert myself
getting supper ready.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Josh?” asked Jack, looking up
from his work of fastening the lower rim of the
tent to the pegs that had been driven securely
into the earth.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, Jack,” explained the other, lowering
his aggressive voice a little when addressing
the commodore, “I thought I’d make the
fire over here till I saw you’d changed the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of the tent; and then I crossed over to
where she’s burning cheerfully now. So I laid
some things down that I meant to cook for
supper&mdash;two slices of that ham I cut off while
afloat; a can of Boston baked beans, and part
of the fish Buster hooked and that nearly got
away with him. Now, mind you, I ain’t mentionin’
any names, but some busybody’s gone
and took the entire outfit, and hid it away.
How d’ye think the cook c’n perform his calling,
when they’re playin’ tricks on him like that,
tell me?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence for about half a
minute, while the boys looked at each other
questioningly.</p>

<p>Then Buster raised his hand, and said,
earnestly:</p>

<p>“Not guilty, Jack, sure I never even saw
the old ham; and ketch me a-playin’ any tricks
on the cook, and me that hungry I c’d eat any
old thing.”</p>

<p>One by one of the others, even to George,
copied Buster’s example, and solemnly denied
having tried to annoy the hard-working Josh
by purloining the stuff he had laid out for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>“Must a mislaid it, that’s what, Josh,”
declared Herb, consolingly. “Sometimes my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mind plays hob with me that way. Everybody
get a move on and look for the grub. We just
can’t afford to have our goods floating around
every-which-way right in the start. We’ve got
to find it, that’s what.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, before you get to running around
wild,” interrupted Jack, and somehow when he
spoke in that way it seemed as if all the other
fellows felt as though Jack had conceived an
idea, for he was always quick along those lines.</p>

<p>“What’s doing, Jack?” inquired Buster.</p>

<p>“I want to ask Josh particularly where it was
he laid that stuff out,” continued the other, impressively.</p>

<p>“Why, just like I said, over ther by that
clump of brush,” the cook explained, as he
pointed in the quarter indicated.</p>

<p>“On that flat stone, perhaps?” continued
Jack.</p>

<p>“Now, that was just what I did, Jack,”
Josh went on to say, “and when I stepped over
just now to get the stuff, why, it wasn’t there.
I scratched my head, and tried to remember
moving it, but I’d take my affidavy that I never
came back to get it till just now, after I got my
fire good and ready. That’s the way it was,
Jack.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” remarked the other, as he
started for the spot in question.</p>

<p>They all watched him curiously. First he
bent down, and sniffed of the stone.</p>

<p>“He’s smelling to see if the ham ever rested
there, that’s what,” declared Josh.</p>

<p>“And now look at him on his hands and
knees, alongside that flat stone, would you?”
remarked Buster, wonderingly. “Whatever do
you reckon Jack’s got in his head, fellers?”</p>

<p>“He’s getting up now, and we’ll know right
soon, which is one comfort,” George observed.</p>

<p>Jack beckoned them over, and as soon as they
came running pell-mell, he wagged his head in
a mysterious fashion, and pointed down to a
spot near his feet.</p>

<p>“That stuff didn’t walk off on its own account,
boys; if you look sharp you’ll see what
did the little trick!” and as their eyes instantly
turned down toward the ground they saw the
plain imprint of a great big shoe there!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST CAMP FIRE OF THE TRIP</small></h2>


<p>“Holy smoke! so that’s what the matter, is
it?” exclaimed Buster, as he stared at the telltale
track.</p>

<p>“A thief, that’s what!” breathed George,
angrily, as he turned to glance at the neighboring
growth of trees, now partly lost in the gloom
of coming night.</p>

<p>“And to think,” remarked Herb, “that anybody
could just slip along here back of these
bushes, and grab our grub without one of us
seeing him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we were all too busy doing our regular
stunts to think of such a thing,” explained
Jack. “You see, Josh had all he wanted to do
with the fire; some of us were putting up the
tent the second time; and George had his
hands full with his pet hobby, bothering over
his engine. Why, it was as easy as falling off
a log for him to just crawl up behind these
bushes, reach out a hand, and then good-bye
to all the fine stuff Josh had laid out so nice.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that don’t beat the Dutch!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Josh, staring hard at the stone which
bore such an important part in all this discussion,
as though he could hardly believe his eyes.</p>

<p>“Look here,” continued Jack, “and you can
see where the ground is all rubbed up; that’s
where his knees scraped on the surface when he
dragged one leg after the other, you know.”</p>

<p>“My! it takes you to get on to these things,
Jack!” declared Buster.</p>

<p>Andy had said nothing up to now, but seemed
to be just as much puzzled and disturbed as
the rest. He managed to put in his oar at
about this point, however.</p>

<p>“Musha! they do be sayin’ that this same
ould island do be ha’nted; and ’tis me own
silf that will be belavin’ the same afther this,
so I will!”</p>

<p>“Great governor! he means it was a regular
ghost, Jack, d’ye hear that?” cried Buster,
throwing up his chubby hands in rank despair.</p>

<p>Everybody seemed interested at once; for,
while several of the boys, if asked to their face
might have promptly declared they never believed
in ghosts; still, it was so very queer,
finding some unknown party on the island with
the bad name, that they were inclined to listen
with interest when Andy aired his views. Ghosts&mdash;of
course not,&mdash;because they were all humbug,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
anyway; but it was mighty strange how that
stuff vanished so mysteriously.</p>

<p>Jack laughed out loud.</p>

<p>He was a level-headed, practical boy, and had
not a grain of superstition in his whole body.
Many a time had he and Andy argued and disputed
upon this very score, and the one whose
ancestors had come from the island across the
sea had apparently so far as outward appearances
went, at least, been convinced of the error
of his ways, only to have the old belief crop up
again unexpectedly on the first occasion. It
was in the blood; and what is there cannot be
argued away.</p>

<p>“Stop and think, Buster, and you, Andy,”
Jack went on to say, impressively, “ghosts
wouldn’t be apt to wear big boots, would they,
and come creeping along, when they are popularly
supposed to have the power of making
themselves invisible?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jack, you’re right!” burst out
George, enthusiastically. “Get your gun, and
we’ll take a look for the rascal, and make him
stand and deliver.”</p>

<p>But Jack paid no attention to this fiery threat;
if they tried to carry out one-tenth of the things
impulsive George suggested, it would surely
keep them busy, well and good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“And whoever heard of a hungry ghost?”
Jack went on to say, so as to rub it in, good and
hard. “This fellow, whoever he could have been,
must have been hungry; for he cribbed our
ham and stuff the first shot. Well, it’s gone;
but thank goodness we’ve got plenty more;
so I say, don’t let’s have such a little thing make
us feel bad. Get busy, some of you, and fix
the cook up with a second ration. Herb, cut
two more slices off the ham, and Buster, you
turn your hand at carving that hunk of fish
we’ve still got. Such a trifle shouldn’t upset
fellows who had been through all we have, you
know.”</p>

<p>“No more it hadn’t!” cried Buster.</p>

<p>“Bully for the Commodore; he’s the right
stuff!” exclaimed Josh, waving the stick of wood
he happened to be holding in his hand at the
time; and looking very much like a real French
chef with his cute little white cap on his head.</p>

<p>“But hey, let’s first of all get every bit of our
stuff in the tent, and keep a close watch on the
same,” observed suspicious George. “First
thing you know we’ll just have to abandon our
week of fun down here because we’re starved
out. We didn’t agree to feed all the stray
fishermen, or hoboes in the country, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
laid in our supplies this time; ain’t that a fact,
Jack?”</p>

<p>It was strange how all the other boys almost
invariably turned to Jack when they had advanced
a proposition; as though his guarantee
was all that was necessary to stamp the suggestion
as a clever idea.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right there, George; and while
the rest of you are doing all you can to help
Josh out, I’ll be collecting the duffle in the tent,
and fixing the same so it won’t bother us much.
If any chap manages to hook more of our stuff
from under our very noses, he’ll deserve it,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>So saying, Jack started to carry things in
under the canvas, for the tent had been about
fully erected at the time Josh made his astonishing
statement; and only needed to be fastened
down a little more securely at the base,
so as to be ready to stand any sort of a blow, such
as might come along in the spring time here on
the upper Mississippi.</p>

<p>The air was getting a little “nippy,” as Buster
called it; so that several of the motorboat boys
had donned their sweaters. This made Buster
start to again bemoaning the strange disappearance
of his new one, that had the blue moon
on the breast. He never could convince himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that he had mislaid it in the shed where the
boats had been housed for the winter; and
fancied that one of his chums must be hiding
it from him; because every little while he would
watch each one in turn, and with hope struggling
afresh upon his rosy, plump face, only to have
it die out again when he realized they were not
dragging the familiar object out of their clothes
bags.</p>

<p>Secretly Buster was determined that at the
first chance he would rummage through each one
of those bags himself, and make positive that
his missing property was not reposing where it
never should be found.</p>

<p>The supper preparations went on apace, and
soon the most delightful odors ever sniffed by
hungry cruisers began to permeate the surrounding
atmosphere. Buster went into the
tent, calling back over his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Just going to lie down a while on my blanket,
to see how she goes, fellers. Fact is, I’m that
cramped after a session aboard the speed boat
that I c’n hardly stretch out. And then, to
own up to the real truth, them smells make me
just wild, and I can’t stand it around the fire
any longer. Just call me when everything’s
ready, Josh, that’s a good feller. Oh! my! but
that coffee is scrumptious; and the ham, goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gracious! whoever smoked that pig knew
how to fix things so’s to set a hungry boy half
crazy. Yum! yum! Don’t forget to wake me,
now, Josh!”</p>

<p>But of course it was not long before supper
was declared ready, and the boys proceeded
to gather around the spot where Josh had set
things. Buster was not called, in fact there was
no need, for he burst out of the tent like a young
cyclone just at this time, and hastened to find
a place to deposit his fat form in the circle.</p>

<p>“Hey! thought’d you steal a march on me,
didn’t you, fellers?” he demanded, trying to
look very fierce, which was impossible, for he
only screwed up his face and seemed comical
at such times; “meant to just eat up my share,
and then tell me you forgot all about giving me
the high sign. But I was on to your little
game, let me tell you. Could hear every word
you said, and when Josh here told George to
pass out his pannikin, that gave me my cue.
Thank you, Josh, I believe I will dip in next;
and Herb, fill my tin-cup with that coffee,
please. Oh! ain’t I glad we’ve got started at
last. That last ten minutes was just awful to
me!”</p>

<p>So Buster rattled on until the others begged
him to stop it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the food close that trap of yours, Buster,
please,” said George. “That’s the way he
goes, ding-dong, the whole blessed day, fellows;
until I can hardly think straight, when I’m trying
to figure on how to bridle that high-stepper
of a motor of mine.”</p>

<p>They were soon all hard at work, and after
the first keen edge of their appetites had been
taken off, it was a merry group that gathered
near the fire, eating, chatting and with a continual
flow of wit passing back and forth.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Jack could not forget about the
mysterious disappearance of the food, and every
little while he would get up, to take a stroll
around to the other side of the tent; just as
though he half feared that some daring intruder
might try to cut into the back of the canvas,
with the intention of continuing his depredations.</p>

<p>“How about that old paper Andy brought
with him?” asked George, after they had eaten
all that was possible; and even Buster was seen
to shake his head when Josh asked if anybody
would have any more coffee, baked beans,
crackers, or cheese.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s a fact!” cried Herb, “we went
and forgot all about it. You see, Jack crammed
it in a pocket of his old jacket; and all of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were that anxious to be off we didn’t remember
to have the account of the robbery read out.
Got it yet, haven’t you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“Sure I have,” replied the other, “and if you
wait a minute I’ll get the same, so we can enjoy
the thrilling story right here and now. Those
kind of yarns always sound better around the
blazing camp fire, you know.”</p>

<p>“Kinder go with ghosts, and all that sort of
thing, eh?” came from Buster, who was eyeing
the remnant of ham in the fryingpan, and heaving
a sigh, as though it really gave him a pain
to think that his capacity seemed to have been
reached before the last bit had been disposed
of; that was next door to a sin with Buster, who
would gorge himself rather than see the least
thing wasted, or thrown away.</p>

<p>“Ghosts don’t burgle any that I ever heard
of,” observed Josh, calmly picking up the said
skillet, and with a fling sending a small portion
of the fatty end of ham flying into the bushes,
at which Buster sank back, disappointed.</p>

<p>“Arrah, sure they do the quarest things ye
iver heard till on,” declared Andy; and then
gave a quick look at Jack, as though half expecting
to be taken to task because of his clinging
belief in hobgoblins, and all such things.</p>

<p>But Jack did not see fit to pay the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
attention to anything so trifling just then. He
passed into the tent, to where he had hung his
coat; for with his sweater on he had not felt
the need of extra covering. And presently he
came out again, carrying the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that too mean for anything,
boys?” he remarked.</p>

<p>“What’s gone wrong now, Jack; I hope more
of our provisions haven’t taken wings, and
skipped out?” observed George; while Buster
just sat there, hugging his fat knees and holding
his breath while he waited to hear the worst.</p>

<p>“Oh! no; nothing like that,” came the answer,
“but you see I had this coat on a good part of
the morning, and I guess the paper must have
got wet somehow, for there’s only part of the
first page left; most of the account of the
robbery is gone. But I’ll read you what there
is, if you want. It’s the tail end, of course.
Too bad it had to happen that way.”</p>

<p>“Go on, then, and let’s have what there is,
Jack,” urged Josh.</p>

<p>“About where the lines begin to run even
it starts in this way,” remarked Jack. “‘The
only clues they have of the robbery consist,
first of all, in several tools which Mr. Hasty, the
blacksmith, identified as part of his machinist’s
outfit, showing that they had entered his shop;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and the fact that yesterday a dapper little
naphtha launch, painted white, with a red
band around the upper part, was known to be
anchored just above town. Two parties occupied
the same, one a well-dressed young fellow,
with a sharp look about him; and the other
a heavy man, more like a mechanic. The police
have no doubt that these parties are the
ones who broke into the bank, and cleaned out
the vault. The smart looking young fellow
must have planned the scheme. He was seen
in the bank during the day, getting some information,
and a big bill changed, and it is supposed
that he took his bearings at that time he
was chatting with the cashier. From the description
the latter was able to give of his visitor
it has been learned from St. Paul that the smooth
faced young fellow was positively a well known
and skilful crook called by the name of Slim
Jim. The authorities hope to be able to get on
to their track up or down the river shortly.’”</p>

<p>Just as Jack ended this report Buster was
heard to give a startled cry.</p>

<p>“What ails him now?” demanded Josh, looking
toward the fat boy.</p>

<p>“Just what I thought, he’s gone and overfed,
and now he’s feeling a gripe coming on; he’ll
sure burst some fine day,” grumbled George,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
groaning to think that all during the trip he must
put up with such a rolypoly of a crew as Buster
Longfellow.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t neither,” snapped the other, indignantly.
“I c’n breathe as well as any feller
present. I gave that little gasp-like because I
was staggered, when Jack, he read about that
trim little boat painted white, with the red
trimmin’ around the gunnel. Want to know
why, don’t you? Well, the fact is, fellers, I
set eyes on that pirate craft myself, and not
so very long ago either; fact is, just half an
hour before we struck here. Now, what d’ye
think of that, hey?” and Buster expanded perceptibly,
doubtless feeling his own importance
as the bearer of startling news.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>A STARTLING INTERRUPTION</small></h2>


<p>“Whee!” exclaimed Josh, hardly able to
believe his ears when he heard the fat boy
make this astonishing declaration so positively.</p>

<p>George also expressed more or less surprise,
though from the look on his face it was evident
that he was beginning to guess something in
connection with what his “crew” was stating.</p>

<p>Jack immediately took Buster in hand. It
was the only way of making him tell all he
knew, without forever “beating about the
bush,” and giving himself lots of airs; for
Buster seldom found himself in the center of the
stage; and when such an event did come along
he wished to make the most of it. What boy,
wouldn’t, tell me?</p>

<p>“See here,” Jack went on to say, “you want
to tell us all about that, now, Buster; because
you’ve just made a startling statement; and
we hope you can back it up. How could you
see that boat, and none of the rest of us notice
it; tell us that in the first place.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! that’s easy enough, fellers,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the other, bent on making the most of his
advantage. “Tell you how that was. You
may remember that George found himself
away ahead, near the close of the run; and as
George, he doesn’t like to hold up even a little
bit, what did he do but spin away over to the
other shore, and go down that, say about five
miles above the upper end of this blooming
old island.”</p>

<p>“Oh! get a move on, old Ice-Wagon; you’re
as slow as molasses in winter!” groaned impulsive
George; whereupon the fat boy turned
deliberately toward him to say:</p>

<p>“Who’s telling this story, me or you, George
Rollins? If I am, then you just keep your hands
off, and let me spin the yarn my own way.
Don’t expect me to be a whirlwind like you, for
I ain’t built that way; you’re a match, and
I’m a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tub; but never mind, Buster, please go
on!” urged Josh.</p>

<p>“Well, of course George, he had his head
stuck down close to his engine, watching every
stroke it made, and couldn’t see anything, only
when he bobbed up every little while to tell
me how to steer. And we went in fairly close
to the shore. All at once, in a snug little cove
behind a tongue of high land, I saw the boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
She was anchored there; and first thing I saw
was a young feller, just like that paper tells on,
asittin’ on the gunnel, and directin’ a heavy-set
chap, who was in jumpers, and looked like he
was the engineer, deck hand and crew all rolled
in one; he seemed to be mendin’ the engine, or
doin’ something like that.”</p>

<p>“But how was it you didn’t call the attention
of George to the boat?” asked Jack.</p>

<p>“It was cruelty to animals, that’s what,”
echoed Josh, “because, think how joyful it’d
make our chum to know that other people had
their engine troubles as well as him?”</p>

<p>“Oh! he did tell me to look,” admitted George
just then, nodding his head, “but we were going
so very fast, you know, that when I did get my
head up it was just too late; I had a glimpse of
the tip-end of some sort of boat in that cove he
mentions; and then the bully little Wireless
flipped by like a streak of light. Give you my
word for it, fellows, we must have been flying
along at the rate of nearly twenty miles per
just then, current and all.”</p>

<p>“Ah! rats!” ejaculated some one, and George
did not know who had spoken, for the voice
seemed to come from anywhere; but he just
glared around, and then, shaking his head
menacingly, he muttered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better not be so plain next time, whoever
said that; or it might bring on trouble. I c’n
stand nearly anything about myself, but I won’t
hear my pet boat sneered at. Yes, it was
all of twenty miles, understand!” and he again
looked at Andy, Buster and Josh, as though
daring any one to express another doubt.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack, “here’s some fun for us,
now. If that description of the robber launch
holds good; and Buster didn’t see something
that wasn’t there, then it seems that we’ve got
the thieves, and all their plunder, here within
five miles of us right now. That’s interesting,
if true, as the papers say.”</p>

<p>George began to grow excited.</p>

<p>“Get that gun of yours ready, Jack, the
trusty old Marlin that has stood between us
and trouble many a time!” he exclaimed, jumping
to his feet, as though in a frame of mind to
go rushing off, pell-mell, on some reckless
errand.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the more cautious Herb.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t it look like it’s up to us to surround
that pirate craft, and capture the bold
burglars? Remember what we did once before
when cruising down this same old Mississippi!
And then again, there was that stunt we pulled
off up among the Thousand Islands later on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Ain’t you meaning to take a hand in this thing,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t know,” replied the other, carelessly.
“I really don’t see why we should be
called on to take the place of a sheriff’s posse
every little while, and risk our precious lives.
None of our folks that I know of have any
interest in that looted bank up at Lawrence.
And these kind of men are a dangerous proposition
to handle, let me tell you. It would be a
different matter if they broke in on us, and we
got mixed up with the pair in spite of things.
Then we’d just have to do our level best to
capture the lot, and return the plunder to the
cheering citizens of Lawrence.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” exclaimed Josh, pretending to
clap his hands.</p>

<p>“But chances are, there’ll be something of a
reward offered for the apprehension of the
thieves, and the safe return of the money,”
persisted George, although less strenuously than
before.</p>

<p>“Well, what of that?” remarked Herb. “We
ain’t officers of the law, sworn to take all sorts
of risks, just because some bad men get away
with the funds of any old country bank, are
we? Let ’em lock up things better, or hire a
night watchman as the people in our town do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
these days. Guess that goes, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“It certainly strikes at the root of the matter,
as Professor Mapes would say, Herb,” replied
the other, quietly. “And then again, how do
we know but what circumstances might arise
to make us take a hand in the game? What
more likely than that those same fellows would
pick on this island to hide for a while, until the
chase for them gets played out.”</p>

<p>“Great brain, Jack!” cried Buster; “that’s
as true as smoke. Fellers like them are dead
sure to know that Bedloe’s Island’s got a bad
name among honest folks; and that it’d be the
boss hide-out for a couple of crooks that thought
the officers might be rushin’ up and down the
river looking for ’em.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Herb, “and if they’re as smart
as we think they are, chances’d be they would
have brought some paint along with ’em, too.”</p>

<p>“Paint?” ejaculated Josh, “now, I c’n understand
why Mr. Kedge, the boatbuilder who owns
the shed where we kept our craft all winter, has
to have that stuff around because he is in the
business of fixing up all sorts&mdash;say, looky here.
Herb, d’ye mean they’d want to change their
boat from white to something else; is that your
smart idea?”</p>

<p>Herb just nodded his head. He was not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
given to talk; but once in a while could be
depended on to break in with a suggestion; and
as a rule what Herb said was worth listening to.</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed George, always ready to
admit the fact when one of his mates really had
a good idea.</p>

<p>“That’s where your head is level, Herb, me
bye!” declared Andy.</p>

<p>Jack smiled, and nodded, as though he considered
it a point well taken. What more
natural than that two smart rogues, trying to
escape after committing such a bold robbery,
and traveling in such a conspicuous boat, should
think to prepare themselves with a pot of black
or gray paint, with which to completely alter
the appearance of their craft while hiding in some
secluded spot, such as the island in the middle
of the river afforded?</p>

<p>“Well, we can keep that idea in mind,” Jack
went on to say, “and for one night set a watch,
so that if they should happen along we’d know
it.”</p>

<p>“Huh! that makes me feel bad!” grunted
Josh.</p>

<p>“What about?” demanded Buster.</p>

<p>“Here I’ve been counting on having the
jolliest old camp fire the first night out you ever
heard tell of. Been dreaming about it for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
week past, and seein’ the flames shootin’ up,
with the sparks sailin’ away out over the river;
and here you go and throw cold water on that
scheme right in the start. No camp fire tonight!
Why, half of the fun’d be lost if we had
to do the same thing every night, Jack, believe
me.”</p>

<p>Josh did not look very happy over the gloomy
prospect; so Jack had to cheer him up the best
way possible.</p>

<p>“It would only be for the one night, I reckon,
Josh,” he remarked, consolingly, “and if nothing
happens before morning, why, after that you
can make fires to the limit of the wood on the
island, if only you don’t burn us all out.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well,” Josh went on to say, “if all the
rest of you look at it that way, course I’ve got
to give in, because majority rules in this club,
always. So let the fire die out if you want;
I’m not going to bother putting another stick
on it. Guess, with our sweaters and coats we
c’n be warm enough as we sit here and talk.”</p>

<p>“But all of us ain’t got sweaters,” exclaimed
Buster, shiveringly, “’less somebody happens
to have my blue moon one stickin’ at the bottom
of his bag. Now, don’t everybody get mad at
what I’m sayin’, and turn on me savagely.
Course I mean that it might a-got in there just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by accident like. And I’d be ever so much
obliged if you’d look and see. A sweater is a
mighty fine thing to have sometime, which right
now is one of ’em; and when you don’t find it,
you feel as blue as that moon mine had on the
breast.”</p>

<p>Jack obligingly turned out all the contents
of his bag, as did Andy and Herb, but Josh and
George disdained to bother, saying they just
knew it was no use, as they had a complete
record of every lasting thing that was in their
kits, and what was the need anyway; because
a fellow as careless as Buster chose to leave one
of his useful garments hanging somewhere in
that boat builder’s shed, for he was always
forgetting to fasten the lockers of his boat when
he left it, and everything like that; why should
they be put to such a nuisance?</p>

<p>But Buster eyed the pair suspiciously, especially
Josh. Truth to tell, it was on this
individual that the burden of his belief fell; for
was not the other continually trying to play a
trick on him?</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll know before a great while,”
Buster was saying to himself, as he lay back,
having wrapped his blanket around his shoulders,
in order to ward off the chill breeze that found
its way to them, in spite of the fact that trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and underbrush lay in dense masses between
the northern end of the island and the spot
which they had chosen for their camp.</p>

<p>They talked for a while, but by degrees it
might have been noticed that for some unknown
reason their voices gradually became more and
more subdued; though if asked the cause for
this hardly any one could have ventured an
explanation. But possibly the subject they
had recently been discussing, in connection with
the chances of the two suspects making for the
island, in order to lie there for some days, while
they changed the color of their boat from white
to black, may have had an influence on them all.</p>

<p>George was of course bothering his head about
his one favorite pastime, and trying to puzzle
out just how he could do something to his
tricky engine in order to get more speed out of
it, and at the same time stop its balky ways.
Buster, on his part, was perhaps making a mental
calculation concerning the amount of stores
they had brought along; for he had a dim suspicion
that before they wished to return home
the stock would fall low, and the whole of them
be put on short rations; a thing that would
seem very much like a calamity to Buster.</p>

<p>And each one of the others seemed to have
something on his mind; for presently absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
silence had fallen on the little group. This was
a most unusual occurrence, for as a rule several
of the boys dearly loved to hear themselves
speaking, and would air their views at the
slightest excuse for doing so.</p>

<p>Jack, sitting there in what seemed to be a
reverie, had his head against the trunk of a good-sized
tree. This may have acted as a conductor
of sound, for he seemed to catch a certain noise
before any of the others did; and none of them
could be accused of dull hearing, either.</p>

<p>“Hark, everybody!” he said suddenly, in a
low, thrilling tone, that seemed to startle his
companions, for everyone of them sat up straight.</p>

<p>“What did you think you heard, Jack?”
whispered Buster, unconsciously lowering his
voice.</p>

<p>“Something that sounded like the gurgling
of water against the side of a boat, and voices
in the bargain,” replied the other. “There, if
you try, you can get the same thing yourself.
Seems to me there are push poles being used to
turn a boat in against the shore up above here
a little ways.”</p>

<p>All of them strained their ears. A minute,
two of them, passed, and they heard the swishing
sounds Jack mentioned, each being followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
a “plunk,” as of a pole being dropped into the
water for another push.</p>

<p>Then a voice, rather soft and melodious, came
drifting to their ears.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Jenks; we can tie up to the
shore here, all right, and in the morning look
for a suitable cove to lay the boat in, while we
get to work, and make the changes. Just think
of it breaking down above this island again.
Only for the old bunch of ground sticking out
here in the river we’d have had to anchor. And,
Jenks, I guess we might as well bury that box
here as tote it any further, you know. I hate to
leave a thing I cared for so much behind, but it
can’t be helped.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE TREASURE CACHE</small></h2>


<p>“H’st! keep quiet!”</p>

<p>As Jack gave utterance to this whisper he
set about gaining his feet without making any
racket. And no sooner had he accomplished
this than he started to stepping on what few
red embers of the fire there chanced to be left;
so that almost in a “jiffy,” as Buster would have
called it, the last glow had been effectually
smothered, and there was no longer anything
to betray the campers, unless the khaki-colored
water-proof tent happened to show later on,
should the moon rise.</p>

<p>They could hear the new arrivals making a
landing, and talking about starting a fire, in
order to cook some supper. The one who had
the smooth voice, and whom they could easily
believe to be the younger fellow Buster had
mentioned as sitting at his ease, watching the
heavier man work at the engine, George’s
style, declared that a meal on shore would not
go bad.</p>

<p>“And,” he added, the words coming plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to the ears of the listeners close by, “I don’t
believe there’s any danger of our being come up
with yet awhile. We’ve got too good a start
on those fellows, to worry. Fact is, I wouldn’t
care if we had to stay here in this snug nook all
of tomorrow, and get things fixed to suit us.
Let ’em go on past, and hunt for us; we could
slip by the lot the next dark night, and give
’em the merry ha! ha! Ain’t that so, Jenks,
old man?”</p>

<p>The other evidently said it was. He seemed
to be a man of few words, and was quite satisfied
to let his glib-tongued crony do most of the
talking, which the younger man was well able
to carry on.</p>

<p>Presently the glimmer of a fire through the
brush and trees announced that they had indeed
started a blaze, and were evidently preparing
to cook supper. From certain conversation
that followed concerning what this meal was to
consist of Jack and his chums were quickly
convinced that while this young fellow might be
a bold and bad bank thief, he must have been
brought up in the lap of luxury, judging from
the fact that Jenks was instructed to have the
“porterhouse steak and the mushrooms” for
supper, together with coffee, and several other
things that appealed to the appetites of hungry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cruisers, but which did not strike the boys that
way, simply because their stomachs had been
satisfied.</p>

<p>“Listen to that, would you?” whispered
George in the ear of Jack, whom he happened
to be very near at the time, “he said ‘get it
off the ice, and be careful to shut down the ice-box
lid too!’ Think of these bold buccaneers
cruising with such a luxury aboard as an ice-box?
Whew!”</p>

<p>“Not so loud, George, or they may hear you,”
warned Jack, although he himself thought that
the fact was a remarkable one; but then the
young chap must have been a high-stepper in
his palmy days, before he took to evil ways; and
possibly old habits clung to him still; so that,
having the ready cash, he wanted to have all
the luxuries going, along with him. Tenderloin
steak and mushrooms sounded like it, that was
certain. Perhaps they would be toasting each
other at the end of the supper in champagne, at
five dollars the bottle, Jack thought. When
wicked men break into bank vaults, and make
way with all the treasure they find there, surely
they can indulge in any sort of extravagance for
a short time afterwards.</p>

<p>The supper was finally cooked.</p>

<p>During this time the six boys had been slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and cautiously creeping up through the brush,
and between the trees, it being their intention
to see what the two fugitives, who were fleeing
before the officers of the law looked like.</p>

<p>But they did not dare go very close, and
hence most of what passed between the precious
pair at the fire came to them only in a rumble
of voices. But they could at least watch them
and it was easy to understand that they seemed
to be debating some point very seriously; for
once the young fellow went aboard the boat,
and when he came back he bore a box under his
arm, which he carefully deposited on the ground
near by. And how it thrilled every watcher
as he saw this act, for there could be no doubt
in the world but that this same chest was one
containing all the treasure these bad men had
taken from that Lawrence bank.</p>

<p>But the younger man, who was smooth-faced
and boyish looking in fact, also took a folded
paper from his pocket, which he opened and
then both of them bent low down over the same,
occasionally tracing along its surface, with a
finger.</p>

<p>“It must be a chart of the river!” George
took occasion to faintly whisper in Jack’s ear,
taking advantage of the murmur of the night
wind among the branches of the trees overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course this did not enlighten Jack any,
since he had jumped at the same conclusion
long before. But the fact of the others studying
a map of the river’s crooked course was highly
significant, he thought. It told that they realized
the danger they stood in of being overtaken,
and that they meant to lay out a plan
whereby they could elude pursuit.</p>

<p>Jack was studying the pair as he lay there
back of the bushes.</p>

<p>He wondered whether the younger one, who
seemed to be at the head of the dangerous combination,
could be acting a part. This idea
came to Jack because, as far as he was able to
see, the other looked as though he hardly possessed
brains enough to carry him through any
ordinary trouble; and as to plotting such a bold
thing as looting a country bank, why, Jack found
it hard to believe he would be capable of it.
But still, he knew very well that it is not always
safe to judge from first appearances. While the
skipper of the white power-boat might seem to
be a bit of a “sissy,” that might all be assumed
for a purpose, to allay suspicion, a part he liked
to play; and that should occasion ever call for
a display of force and ugliness, the fellow might
throw off that careless demeanor as one would
an old glove, appearing in his real colors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>And while lying there, watching, and trying
to pick up a sentence now and then, as the pair
chanced to speak in a little louder tones, Jack
busied himself in speculating what sort of
chances they would have, did they finally decide
to accept of the opportunity to close in on
the two rascals, and bring about their arrest.</p>

<p>It would be taking a certain risk of course,
and he did not want to expose his chums to any
unnecessary chances for getting hurt; but all
the same temptation loomed up large before
Jack’s eyes.</p>

<p>At any rate, he thought, it would do no harm
to try and keep a watchful eye on the pair, and
see what they were up to. Had he not in the
beginning heard the leader say that they might
as well bury the treasure on the island as carry
it further with them. Of course they meant
to come back again, and get possession of whatever
that small box contained.</p>

<p>The thought of getting hold of the stolen
bank funds and papers gave Jack a nice warm
little thrill. He was only a boy, and yet he
knew how splendid it was to return home, and
hear the people cheering him, while the town
band played “Lo, the Conquering Hero Comes.”
And once before had they been instrumental in
recovering plunder that had been taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wandering yeggmen; which fact had helped
swell the contents of the club’s strong-box, and
enabled the members to take several long and
expensive trips.</p>

<p>Now those by the fire seemed to have finished
their supper, for they arose, and the more
boyish looking of the pair picked up the box
again. It looked as though they might be about
to hunt for some hiding-place, where it could be
placed, and safely kept until it was wanted
again.</p>

<p>“Get that sharp-pointed stick, Jenks,” he
remarked, pointing as he spoke, “that might do
in place of a spade. You see, we didn’t bring
that sort of tool along, because we never thought
we’d need one. But you ought to be able to
scratch out a deep enough hole to cram this in.
I hope nobody disturbs it again, that’s all. I’d
hate to know that was so. Now, come over this
way, Jenks. It won’t take any great length
of time.”</p>

<p>He spoke with a slight lisp that made him
seem much more effeminate than might otherwise
have been the case. And to the alarm of
Buster the pair actually started toward the
quarter where the six lads were flattened out as
close as they could get to the ground.</p>

<p>But then the shadows lay thick, and besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
before there was any real danger of discovery
they heard him say again:</p>

<p>“I imagine this ought to do as well as anywhere,
Jenks, just behind this bush, you notice.
Now, see how you can root out the earth with
that stick and your hands. I should think that
a hole some fifteen or eighteen inches deep
would be enough. There, it seems to work all
right, doesn’t it, Jenks?”</p>

<p>The heavy-set man said that it did, and continued
to labor on, throwing the dirt out of the
cavity he was making, by a liberal use of the
sharp-pointed stick, then following it up by
scooping with his bent hands.</p>

<p>But not a thing did the aristocratic partner
in the team seem to do in order to assist. He
must be the recognized brains of the crowd,
and as such was entitled to sit by, and give
orders in a rather supercilious way, while the
other did all the real hard work.</p>

<p>When Jenks had scooped out a hole that he
thought deep enough, he paused to wipe his
brow with a red bandanna handkerchief. Meanwhile
the other carefully laid the box in the
cavity.</p>

<p>“It fits first-rate, Jenks,” he announced,
“and now you can cover it up again. Just push
the earth in, you know, like that,” and with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
toe of his shoe he managed to cause some of the
dirt to fall upon the top of the box.</p>

<p>When presently Jenks seemed to have patted
down the disturbed earth the other spoke again.</p>

<p>“We want anybody that comes meddling
around here to think that some one has been
buried, and then they won’t dare disturb things,
you know, Jenks. So I’ll just fix this stone at
the head as though it marked a grave. There,
what do you think of that, Jenks? Takes some
brains to get up a cute little scheme like that,
don’t it, eh?”</p>

<p>Jenks apparently was an echo, for when the
other took snuff he seemed to sneeze, as George
could have expressed it. He immediately remarked
that he thought it a very smart trick,
did credit to the originator; and this pleased
the other for he seemed to chuckle to himself.</p>

<p>Then the pair turned away, and went back to
the neighborhood of the fire, where they settled
down to enjoy the warm blaze; for as the night
advanced the air was really becoming more and
more keen, especially, as Buster thought, for
any unfortunate fellow who had the bad luck to
lose his warm sweater; for the sight of his comrades
enjoying their woolen protectors only
made Buster feel his loss the more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack gave the signal for a retreat. He intimated
in a few whispered words that there was
something very important upon which they
ought to have a consultation; and in order to
do unheard they would have to go back to their
camp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>JACK PLAYS SCOUT</small></h2>


<p>“What’s doing, Jack?” asked George, carefully,
as soon as the whole six of them were well
away from the vicinity of the other camp, and
where they could safely converse, if only every
one spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p>“We ought to talk things over a bit, and
arrange what we want to do about this matter,”
Jack went on to say.</p>

<p>“But ain’t we goin’ to jump on that pair of
scamps, and make ’em our prisoners?” complained
Buster; and to hear his ferocious way of
talking one might easily imagine that the fat boy
was a fighter from the word go, when as a rule
Buster would walk a mile to escape a rumpus, for
he was by nature very peaceable.</p>

<p>“Wait and see what Jack’s got up his sleeve,
you fire-eater!” remarked Josh, scornfully.</p>

<p>“We know where they’ve gone and buried
all the loot, anyhow,” remarked George, as
though that fact gave him particular satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we c’n dig the same up at our convenience,”
added Herb.</p>

<p>“That is, if they don’t change their minds
before morning comes, and get that box up
again,” observed Jack, dryly.</p>

<p>At that there were several little grunts and
exclamations, such as would indicate that the
others did not relish being tantalized in such a
fashion having the treasure-trove under their
thumbs, only to see it snatched away again.</p>

<p>“Say, we oughtn’t to let that chance slip us,
Jack!” urged Josh.</p>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments, too!” echoed George.</p>

<p>“Count me in,” Herb remarked, quietly.</p>

<p>“Same here, arrah, by the token!” Andy
ventured.</p>

<p>“There, Jack,” spoke up Buster, exultantly,
“everybody is of the same mind, that we just
ought to do something or other right away, so’s
to get that stuff in our possession. It wouldn’t
matter so much if the thieves did get away, if
only we could go sailing up to Lawrence, call the
broken-hearted directors of the looted bank
together, and then say: ‘Here, gentlemen,
are your lost securities. Rest in peace! E
pluribus unum!’ Now Jack, don’t say a word
against it, but think up some way that we can
get hold of that box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve got all that figured out already,
Buster,” remarked the other, coolly.</p>

<p>“Then tell us who’s going to creep up and
dig for that box while the two robbers are sitting
beside the fire, playing cards, because that’s
what they started to do when they went back.”</p>

<p>“And ‘Old Maid’ it was, as sure as you live,”
remarked George, as if astonished. “Did you
ever hear of two ferocious pirates playing such
a harmless game as that before? I never did,
for a fact, boys. They keep me guessing right
along. That boy looks too green to be the rascal
they say he is; but I guess he puts it all on
to fool respectable folks. It helps him in gaining
their confidence.”</p>

<p>George could figure things out in fine style
once he got going. The others, however, were
not in any mood just then to try and decide
what sort of a fellow that rather innocent young
chap might turn out to be. They were more
deeply interested in finding out what could be
done about securing that hidden package in
the box.</p>

<p>Already, no doubt, Buster, for instance, was
seeing pictures of all manner of treasure snugly
reposing in the box; and he could also imagine
how his manly chest would swell with importance
when, with his mates, of course, he entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
stricken town of Lawrence, and astonished the
directors of the bank by returning their lost
securities and money.</p>

<p>And the others were possibly in the same boat,
for they had active imaginations, one and all.</p>

<p>Jack had said the matter was already arranged
in his mind; and if he would only hurry
up and take them into his confidence, they would
feel greatly obliged.</p>

<p>But then Jack did not mean to hold back just
to aggravate his companions; that would have
been too small a thing for him to attempt. He
had only waited to hear what each one thought
of the scheme, and then he went on to say
something.</p>

<p>“Now you can see for yourselves,” he began,
“that it would be useless trying to take the whole
bunch over there, and scratch that box up. One
can do the business to a dot, and as I’m accustomed
to scouting more than any of the rest, I
hope you won’t try to raise any objections if I
say I’ll do the job myself.”</p>

<p>He waited to hear what they thought before
making the first move in the direction of carrying
his plan out. But then he might have
known that not one objection would be raised
against his scheme, for they had the fullest confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in whatever he proposed at any and all
times.</p>

<p>The silence that followed was doubtless intended
for consent; but Jack chose to consider
it otherwise. He wanted an expression from
each of his chums.</p>

<p>“George, how about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, I haven’t the slightest objection,”
replied that worthy, readily enough.</p>

<p>“Josh, how about you?”</p>

<p>“Gosh! only too willing,” came the answer.</p>

<p>And Jack put it up to each of the others, until
every one had signified his readiness to accept
the conditions.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” said Jack, “that settles it
for me. And now, watch me get busy, fellows.”</p>

<p>He once more started into the brush. All
this conversation had been carried on, of course,
in undertones. From time to time they could
hear the voices of the other pair raised above the
ordinary not far away; or it might be a laugh
came floating back to where the six boys
crouched, quivering in every nerve with intense
excitement.</p>

<p>Why, Jack thought, even the laugh of Slim
Jim, the cracksman, was very deceptive, it
sounded so boyish and natural; just as though
he did not have a care or a worry in all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
world. He must be a pretty clever young chap
if he could pretend to be such an innocent,
when really he was such a desperate rascal&mdash;so
that paper had stated.</p>

<p>Having quitted the company of his friends,
Jack began to advance in the direction of the
other camp. He needed no better guide than
the glow of the fire they had burning over there
on the shore; though very careful as he crept
through the bushes to take a little different
track than before, because he believed it would
be apt to bring him closer to the bush behind
which that pretended “grave” that was in
reality a cache for stolen wealth, had been so
roughly dug.</p>

<p>Once, as he raised himself to glance around,
he found it possible to see beyond the camp fire,
to the edge of the river, something that none of
them had been able to do hitherto; and what
should meet his eyes but a very jaunty gasoline
launch, of a type that indicated more or less
speed, since it was of narrow beam, and would
doubtless have quite taken the eye of George
Rollins.</p>

<p>Of course Jack chuckled a little when he saw
the very significant fact that the boat was
painted snow white, and had a nice red line along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the gunwale that gave the craft a rather distinguished
look.</p>

<p>Again into his mind came the description
which he had read out aloud from the fragment
of paper, concerning the boat in which it was
positive the robbers of the Lawrence bank had
fled down the river. A white launch, nobby
in appearance, and decorated with a red line.
Why, what could be plainer than that? White
launches were not so very common on that part
of the Mississippi; and Jack could not remember
ever having set eyes on one before that was
marked with red as this one appeared to be.</p>

<p>He kept creeping along, making no more noise
than an Indian warrior might; or perhaps one
might say, a snake that can glide swiftly, yet
with hardly the faintest rustle of the dead
leaves.</p>

<p>If he did make an occasional little slip, they
were not on the alert, as red braves might have
been. Doubtless they had not the remotest
suspicion that such a thing as peril threatened,
or that an enemy was within miles of the island
retreat to which they had come to hide, and
make preparations for deceiving the posse of
the sheriff, should they chance to meet later
on the river.</p>

<p>No doubt the other five boys had climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
trees or done something else so that they would
be in a position to see him when he reached that
particular bush, back of which the hole had
been dug. They would not be human if they
were going to allow this chance to witness the
unearthing of the treasure pass without an
effort to become spectators.</p>

<p>Jack found that the two beside the fire were
making merry. He eyed them closely, and then
shook his head, thinking that perhaps they
might appear like desperate rogues to an expert
sheriff, accustomed to dealing with rascals of
every kind; but for his part he rather thought
the boy was a spoiled son of a rich man, and
Jenks some humble mechanic out cruising with
the other. But of course, not being well posted
in criminal matters, how could he, a mere tyro,
be expected to be able to judge what people were,
just because they laughed in such a care-free
way. Slim Jim they said feared nothing on
earth; slender and young as he was, he had
laughed more than one sheriff to scorn; and
snapped his fingers when traps were sprung only
to find that he was missing.</p>

<p>Now Jack was drawing closer and closer to
that bush. He had marked it well on the previous
occasion, so that there could be no such
thing as mistaking it. Yes, he recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
every twig almost, so closely had he made a
mental photograph of the bush when the two
were planting their “swag” back of it, and
talking about making it appear as though it
were a grave.</p>

<p>If they just kept up that riotous game of “Old
Maid” for ten minutes longer, Jack felt positive
that he could have accomplished his errand,
and left the mound nicely smoothed over as he
found it.</p>

<p>Jack guessed that they would hardly feel
so merry when they discovered that the treasure-trove
had been opened, while they were not
thirty feet away, and the box containing the
stolen securities and the bank bills carried off;
or if they did laugh it would be on the “other
side of their mouths,” as Buster might have
expressed it in his humorous way.</p>

<p>Now he was doing even better, for he had to
pass a little patch where the cover was rather
slim and in order to successfully negotiate it he
was compelled to flatten himself very much on
the order of a flapjack or a pancake.</p>

<p>But then, they seemed to have no eyes for
anything except the cards they were handling.
Two more unsuspicious rascals it would be
indeed difficult to find; at least that was Jack’s
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a piece of great good luck, for his
hand had actually fallen upon the identical
stick with the sharp point which Jenks had used
so successfully when he was digging the hole
in which to bury the treasure box.</p>

<p>Of course Jack picked this up, for he believed
he could make good use of it in his line of business
just about that time.</p>

<p>And now he had gained the bush, so that his
hand actually rested on the little mound of
fresh earth. It gave Jack something of thrill
to realize that he was so very close to all that
amount of loot which these two scamps had
taken from the poor depositors of the Lawrence
bank; for if the institution failed the loss would
fall partly on poor people.</p>

<p>But he lost no time in getting to work with
that odd spade, fashioned from a stick. When
he found that he had loosened the top earth, he
started to dragging it away with his hands, boy
fashion; using the palms as scoops.</p>

<p>So he quickly got down to where he could
touch the flat top of the little box; and then
burrowing alongside, he managed presently to
unheave the same, dragging it out of the cavity.</p>

<p>Then Jack set to work to place several stones
that he had noted close by, in place of the box,
so that the mound would still be as high as ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and look as it though it still contained the chest.</p>

<p>Once in every little while as he did this work,
Jack would glance through the lower part of
the bush in order to make sure that the two card
players were still as much interested in their
innocent game of “Old Maid” as before. But
really he had little need to do this, because their
loud laughter told the fact as plainly as anything.</p>

<p>Then followed the most difficult task of
creeping back over the route he had taken to
reach the place. It had been hard enough when
he could watch those whom he looked on as
enemies; but as now he had to go backwards
part of the time, so as to know when to stop
moving, and lie still, when he thought one of
them glanced that way, it became doubly difficult.</p>

<p>But Jack had not been making an idle boast
when he claimed to be a much better scout than
any one of his five companions. Circumstances
had allowed him in the past to have a certain
amount of experience in this line, such as none
of his boatmates could claim; and that was how
Jack made such a success of his venture.</p>

<p>Now he had passed the crisis in his retreat
and was able to move along faster, even getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to his feet, and in a couching attitude leaving
the hostile camp behind.</p>

<p>When he reached the spot where the dull-colored
khaki tent stood under the tree he found
his five chums awaiting him; and every one of
them was bubbling over with both a desire to
squeeze Jack’s hand, while telling him in whispers
what he thought of such clever work
and at the same time filled with a burning curiosity
to know if the securities and the stolen
money could all be in that humble little box.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>OPENING THE STRANGE BOX</small></h2>


<p>“Didn’t you get it, Jack?” asked Josh, carefully,
as the Commodore joined the eager group
beside the tent. “We all near broke our necks
a-tryin’ to see; and I say you grabbed the box;
but Buster here seems as set on it that you had
to give up the job, because you got back so fast.
Here, what d’ye think of that, Buster? See
what he’s a-carryin’ under his arm, would you?
It takes Jack to do things with a rush, and yet
never have a breakdown!”</p>

<p>“Less noise, Josh!” cautioned Jack, “you
forget who’s so close by. Even if the wind does
rattle the new leaves on the trees, and the water
churn against the rocks on the shore, they might
happen to hear you. Lower that sharp voice
of yours when you say ‘Told you so’!”</p>

<p>All the same every one of his five companions
seemed delighted with his success. Buster had
to even put out his hand and touch the box, before
he would actually be convinced. Buster,
you see, was something of a Doubting Thomas;
he might take other people’s word on occasion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
but he preferred to actually know that things
were so, from his own experience.</p>

<p>“Why, it is a box, sure as you live,” he was
heard to mutter, as though surprised that the
whole thing did not turn out to be just a dream;
and that he would soon wake up.</p>

<p>“And is it heavy, Jack?” asked George,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh! just so-so,” answered the hero of the
raid, as he passed the article in question around,
so that everybody could get the heft of it, even
Buster.</p>

<p>It was laughable to see the way the fat boy
took hold of the little chest; but then each one
firmly believed that it contained quite a little
fortune, and consequently there was something
of due reverence for wealth in his way of handling
the thing.</p>

<p>“I bet you they’ll be hoppin’ mad when they
find out it’s been sneaked away from them after
all their bully trouble in hidin’ the same,” ventured
Buster.</p>

<p>“Yes, and to think of the cuteness of that
fellow makin’ out that it was going to be reckoned
just a regular little grave,” said George,
with a chuckle. “Guess he thought that nobody
would ever dare dig it up then, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
they say, it’s sure a sign of bad luck to disturb a
body.”</p>

<p>“But what are we going to do now?” demanded
Josh.</p>

<p>“Jack, darlint, ain’t we a-goin’ to open the
box, and say for oursilves what lies inside?”
asked Andy. “Sure, ’tis mesilf that’d loike
tell fale with me own hands all the money it
must contain. ’Tis a bank cashier I’m intindin’
to be some foine day, and I loike nothin’
better than to handle cash.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” echoed Josh.</p>

<p>In fact, that was just what every fellow must
have been thinking about then; for they were
pressing closely around Jack, who had once
more taken the box into his charge.</p>

<p>“But how can we ever see anything when we
ain’t got a light, and don’t dare start one for
fear of being discovered?” remarked doubting
George, who as a rule could far excel Buster in
this particular of being skeptical.</p>

<p>“How about the stars; ain’t they enough to
let a feller see just a little?” asked Josh.</p>

<p>“Jack, what do you say?” came from Herb,
willing to let the Commodore decide the question
once and for all.</p>

<p>“First, let’s sit down and try to keep quiet for
a little while,” responded the boy who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
appealed to, “because, unless I miss my guess,
we’re going to have all the light we want to
right away now.”</p>

<p>As the others followed his example, and
dropped upon the ground, pressing closely together,
so that they could get their heads in a
small circle, and be able to do some more talking,
Buster was heard to say, appealingly:</p>

<p>“Now, just what do you mean by that remark,
Jack, I’d like to know? Where would we
get so much light? Anybody got a flash torch
along? No, that’s where we made a big mistake,
you see, forgettin’ so important a thing.
Speak up, Jack, and let’s know all about it,
please.”</p>

<p>“Even if we did forget,” replied Jack, “we’re
going to have the biggest torch you ever heard
tell of, pretty soon; and that’ll give us all
the light we want, take it from me, Buster.”</p>

<p>The fat boy moved a little uneasily.</p>

<p>“Whee! I hope now, Jack, it ain’t anything
like the woods on fire you got in mind,” he asked,
with a sudden vein of alarm in his voice; for
Buster had once passed through a very unpleasant
experience while in a blazing forest, and
often had bad dreams on that account.</p>

<p>Josh made a scornful sound, which was a
favorite habit of his whenever he wished to convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the idea that he looked on some remark of
the stout boy as indicating an unsound mind.</p>

<p>“And us out here on a measly little old island
in the middle of the old Mississippi, at that?”
he observed, caustically, and then wound up
with another “Huh!”</p>

<p>Jack at another time would have been amused
to hear these two go at it, hammer and tongs;
but the present was hardly an appropriate time
for any sort of a dispute or even discussion.</p>

<p>“Suppose you fellows take a look around,”
he remarked, “and perhaps after that you won’t
need to ask me where I’m going to get my
torch.”</p>

<p>After all it was sharp-eyed Andy who made
the discovery.</p>

<p>“Arrah! and sure ’tis the moon he manes!”
exclaimed the Irish lad.</p>

<p>“The moon,” echoed George, “now wherever
do you see any signs of that same thing, I’d
like to know?”</p>

<p>“Would you look at George, starin’ as hard
as he can right into the west?” mocked Josh.
“Since when has the moon taken to risin’ across
the river, George? Reckon you’re a little
mixed in your directions, ain’t you? Been
bobbing over that engine of yours so much you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
get off your base. That’s right, turn your head
around, and you’ll see what Jack means.”</p>

<p>There, somewhere not far from in the east
the sky was brightening along the horizon which
they could manage to see beyond the tumbling
water of the river. Without a doubt it was the
coming moon, sending a few shreds of her silvery
light in advance to paint the way.</p>

<p>“I c’n see the tip of her face right now,
apeekin’ above the line of trees away over there
on the shore,” announced Josh, with a slight
vein of exultation in his partly suppressed
voice.</p>

<p>“That’s roight!” agreed Andy.</p>

<p>As they stood there and looked sure enough
the edge of the moon began to slowly creep into
sight. At first it seemed just for all the world
like a silver pencil marking a bright eyebrow
above the horizon; but gradually this extended,
growing more pronounced all the while, until
even a child could tell that it was the moon
making her nightly bow to the darkened world
below.</p>

<p>Not another word was said until every part
of her now sadly battered disc had come into
view. The moon was not near so beautiful as
on the third night previous, when full; but
there was still a deal of light shining from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
yellow glove hung up there in the heavens like
a huge lantern.</p>

<p>“She’ll do the business all right, Jack&mdash;!”
ventured Buster, just as though he had been
rather uncertain up to then.</p>

<p>“You just bet she will, bully old moon!”
declared George, who was possibly more inclined
to be sentimental than any of the six
boys.</p>

<p>“Say when, Jack,” urged Josh; meaning by
this that he hoped the other would not think
the time had arrived to rip the cover off the
little box, so that they could all have a peep at
its glorious contents, before it was stowed
safely away aboard one of the motor boats.</p>

<p>Jack looked a little doubtingly at the moon,
just hanging above the horizon. “Not near as
much light as she’ll be giving when she gets
higher,” he said, softly; “but then, I guess
we can’t wait for that. You fellows would just
die with anxiety if you couldn’t see pretty soon.”</p>

<p>But while Jack was saying these caustic
words, of course he did not mean anything.
Why, he was just about as keen on wanting to
see the contents of the box as any one of his
chums. That was only a boy’s way of expressing
himself.</p>

<p>Had there been no need of caution Jack could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
have knocked the lid off that box in short order,
by taking the camp hatchet, and making use
of it. The job was not apt to prove quite so
easy when he found himself compelled to simply
pry with the sharp edge of the said little axe.</p>

<p>He worked busily for several minutes, while
the balance of the boys hovered over him, making
various suggestions, and even wanting to
show Jack how it ought to be done; for of
course every fellow considered that he could
accomplish the task better than any one else.</p>

<p>But Jack knew what he was about, and so he
declined to hand over his job to the next one.
He had managed by dint of pressure to get the
edge of the blade inserted under what seemed to
be the lid of the box, and was now engaged in
prying it up, a little at a time.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother Jack so, you fellows,” warned
Herb, who was apparently quite satisfied with
the way things were going. “Leave him alone,
and he’ll fix it all right. He always does, you
know. There you c’n see the lid’s coming
right along. Another pry like that, and you’ll
have her, Jack. Eureka! there she rises, boys!
He’s done it!”</p>

<p>Jack calmly bent the lid fully back, and then
pried it loose, so that it fell over on the ground.
Then he took the little box up in his arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
turned to get the full light of the low moon.</p>

<p>“Jack first, fellers!” cautioned Josh, “don’t
you all crowd the mourners so. Let him take a
peek, and then the rest of us c’n feast our eyes
on all that bully money and stuff. Keep back,
Buster, you ain’t the first in line; that’s George,
and me, I’m second choice. Look at the stuff
Jack’s a-pullin’ out, would you? Seems like
rags or somethin’ like that, to me. Reckon
they just stuffed the top of the box full to keep
the coin from rattling around like. What’s
ailing Jack, fellers? See him a-starin’ in like
he seen a ghost. Gee! but it must be a great
sight, all that boodle from the bank, to make
our partner stare like that. George, get a
move on you, and step up. You’re next, you
know. No crowdin’, Buster. Keep your place
in line, can’t you?”</p>

<p>Jack was indeed standing there, and staring
into the opened box as though he had received
something of a shock; but over his face there
began to creep a semblance of a smile, or a grin,
or something of that character, as he held out
the box for George to take his turn next.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>DISAPPOINTMENT</small></h2>


<p>“Oh! my stars!”</p>

<p>That was what George said, in a faint voice,
as though he was very nearly overcome, after
taking his look into the box, Jack holding the
same most obligingly all the while.</p>

<p>Of course, even this did not have any effect
upon Josh, who was next in line. In fact, if
anything, it served to spur him on to all the
sooner get his peep-in; wondering at the same
time what it could be.</p>

<p>Buster heard Josh give a gasp, as he bent his
head down. It must be something wonderfully
fetching, to influence all of the boys in that
queer way. And consequently Buster, impatient
for his turn, actually put out his hand and
shoved Josh out of the way.</p>

<p>No sooner had he looked than he too gave
evidence of being nearly overcome.</p>

<p>“Great governor! somebody hold me. I’m
going to faint!” was what Buster whispered;
and this suspicious remark made Andy want to
get out of line, only that Herb, coming last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
would not allow such a thing, but actually
shoved the other up until he just had to do his
duty and look.</p>

<p>Andy threw up both hands as he exclaimed,
perhaps in a louder voice than was really discreet:</p>

<p>“Tare and ounds! Be the powers, ’tware a
grave afther all, so it was!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” quivered from the lips of
Herb, as he now hesitated in turn.</p>

<p>“Come on, don’t hang back like that, Herb;
you’ve just got to see!” ventured Josh, laying
hold of the other’s sleeve, and commencing to
drag him forward.</p>

<p>It was like the boy who jumps into the pond
so early in the spring that he is nearly frozen
stiff; but whoever heard of him confessing to
the fact; while his comrades hesitate on the
bank he puts on the most angelic face possible,
and declares that the water is “as warm as
anything;” until he has coaxed them all in;
for misery loves company, they tell us.</p>

<p>So Herb had to do his duty, and look.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, why, it’s only a little puppy
dog after all!” broke from his white lips, as he
stood there and stared.</p>

<p>“That’s just what it is,” replied Jack. “And
after all, that fellow spoke what he meant, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
we thought he referred to another sort of treasure.
This must have been his pet.”</p>

<p>“But Jack darlint,” broke in Andy, “phat
d’ye think he wanted to bury this ki-yi on the
island for at all, at all?”</p>

<p>“What for?” echoed Buster, before Jack
could say a word, “why, because the little beast
had gone and kicked the bucket&mdash;died on him&mdash;you
know.”</p>

<p>“Must have been a pet dog,” suggested
Josh, “’cause we heard him say he felt bad at
putting the thing underground. Say, Jack,
d’ye think now, the little beast could a got hurt
that night when they broke into the Lawrence
bank and looted it? P’raps somebody fired
at the thieves and hit the pup; or it might a got
hold of rat poison somehow.”</p>

<p>“Quit your guessing, Josh; what does it
matter to us how the poor little beast came to
his end?” demanded George, who had a liking
for dogs himself, and seemed to feel less hilarity
than any of the rest, once the shock of the discovery,
and their own disappointment wore
away.</p>

<p>Jack was for taking it as a joke at his expense.</p>

<p>“Say, just think of that splendid sneak of
mine wasted,” he remarked, sadly. “And all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for this, too. I’ve got half a notion to crawl
back again, and bury the poor little wretch
over, just to pay for making such a mistake.”</p>

<p>“But hold on,” Herb observed, “this doesn’t
mean that the two over yonder ain’t what we
took ’em to be, does it? There’s the white boat,
you know, with the red trimming; didn’t Jack
tell us he could see it plain enough anchored close
to the shore? Just because they put a little
pet dog underground don’t make ’em better, I
reckon, eh, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack did not reply immediately. The old
doubts were commencing to work double time
with him. He was beginning to question the
truth of their solution of the problem. Again
he could see the face of the younger fellow, who
had seemed to be hardly more than a boy. Was
that affectation only assumed? Might it not
be a part of the nature of the fellow after all?
Was he a desperate crook, who was able to put on
an air of innocence; or could it be possible they
had made a tremendous mistake, and that he
was a pampered son of some rich man, cruising
in his fine motorboat, with a mechanic as crew
to do the rough work, while he played his part
as skipper of the craft?</p>

<p>Yes, Jack was now in the Doubting Thomas
class. He shook his head, and seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
trying to figure things out, as he laid the box
on the ground, and covered it temporarily with
the lid which had taken him so long to pry off.</p>

<p>“And if they are the bank thieves,” Herb
went on to say, “what d’ye suppose they could
have done with all that stuff they took away?
Think they buried the same before they got
here to this island, Jack, or could it still be on
board the little white boat right now?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes, that’s the stuff; how about it,
Jack?” George went on to add.</p>

<p>“We sure did fall all over ourselves in making
this blunder,” admitted Josh, “and it’s up to
us now to get busy and try to make things
square.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Jack, slowly, as though he
might be revolving this last idea in his mind,
“that’s possible. If these are the right men,
and they’ve not got rid of the plunder up to
now, why, it stands to reason it would be somewhere
on board, that’s right.”</p>

<p>“But seems to me, Jack,” remarked Herb,
suspiciously, “you’re beginning to hedge a heap.
Just a little while ago you were dead sure these
fellows must be the two robbers. Now you
say ‘if they are.’ How’s that? Didn’t you
see their boat, and wasn’t it just what that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
newspaper account said the suspicious craft
looked like.”</p>

<p>“Boys, I admit all that,” the other went on
to say, “but if you stop and think, the article
in the paper didn’t say positively that the white
boat belonged to the bold bank thieves&mdash;only
that it had been seen hanging around, like it
might be in hiding, and they thought it must
have for a crew the two yeggs who broke into
the Lawrence bank. There’s some difference,
you’ll admit between making a positive statement,
and just guessing things.”</p>

<p>“Well, for one, I still believe they are the men
that are wanted,” said George, to prove that he
had not been convinced otherwise.</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” added Josh.</p>

<p>“And for one now,” added impetuous George,
boldly. “I’d like nothing better than to sneak
that boat of theirs away while they sleep.
What d’ye say to that, fellows, ain’t it worth
considering?”</p>

<p>For a minute no one replied. The audacity
of the proposition staggered them, it seemed;
and yet as is nearly always the case with boys,
it appealed to the love of mischief and the daring
that somehow seems to be a part of their nature.</p>

<p>“Say that would be a great stunt, now,”
said Josh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Buster drew a long breath as he went on to
say:</p>

<p>“George, you ain’t so very bad a hand at
laying out a game after all. Whee! just think
how they’d rub their eyes, and stare, when they
woke up in the morning, and went to look for
the jolly old white boat, which wouldn’t be
there.”</p>

<p>George began to feel his importance. After
all, Jack could not have a monopoly of engineering
things; once in a great while some other
fellow was apt to have an inspiration; and it
seemed to be his turn just then.</p>

<p>“You seem to think well of my little scheme?”
he remarked, proudly.</p>

<p>“Jack, how do you feel about it?” asked
cautious Herb, not noticing that the other had
as yet made no comment; which, in some boys
might have signified that they were feeling
jealous; but everybody knew Jack Stormways
could not allow such a thought to enter his head.</p>

<p>“Do you want to know my idea, George?”
asked Jack, frankly.</p>

<p>“I sure do,” came the reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you,” the other went on to
say. “It would be a great stunt to carry off
this white boat, if only we were sure the parties
are the robbers. But stop and think what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
we’d be up against if they were innocent parties.
Why, they could have us arrested for stealing
their craft; and what excuse would we have to
offer? The old gag about not knowing it was
loaded wouldn’t pass in court. We’d get a
heavy fine, even if it wasn’t worse. This is a
time when it’ll pay us to be sure before we go
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Huh! p’raps you’re right, Jack,” grunted
Josh, already beginning to weaken before this
sort of logic.</p>

<p>George did not open his mouth, but he was
always willing to listen to what Jack had to
say; for the other never gloried in showing any
of his comrades up as being in the wrong.</p>

<p>“But the principal thing of all, and which
we’d have to find out first, before thinking of
hooking the boat, would be to know whether
they expect to sleep ashore, or aboard,” Jack
went on to say.</p>

<p>At that Buster tittered.</p>

<p>“Think what a cheeky thing it’d be,” he
remarked, softly, “if we ran away with the boat,
and then found that we’d kidnapped a couple of
innocent ducklings, one of them mamma’s darling
boy! Whew! mebbe we wouldn’t feel cheap
though!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Jack, “then you’ve been thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that this terrible Slim Jim, the dandy hobo,
might be somebody else, have you, Buster?
Well, I tell you what we ought to do, boys&mdash;hang
around, and watch that pair some more.
If they begin to get the camp ready as though
they meant to stay ashore tonight, we can talk
it over again, and decide whether we’ll play
George’s trick or not with the boat. How?”</p>

<p>“I say leave it that way,” ventured Josh,
now completely won over.</p>

<p>“I’m agreeable,” George hastened to say,
for he was not altogether unreasonable in anything
save that troublesome engine aboard his
Wireless; and in that quarter he would never
take advice from any one until in difficulties;
he knew it all.</p>

<p>And so it was arranged.</p>

<p>They could creep up, and from their old place
of observation keep an eye on the two who were
under suspicion; and in this way something
might arise whereby they would be able to tell
definitely whether they would be justified in
going to extremes, or ought to keep their hands off.</p>

<p>Even as they started to once more advance
toward the spot where the camp fire burned,
they began to hear a strange clanking sound,
as of steel smiting steel, that gave them new
cause for wonder.</p>

<small>BUSTER HAS A SHOCK</small></h2>


<p>“What in the wide world’s that?” asked
Buster Longfellow, as they came to a halt in
order to listen.</p>

<p>“Sounds like somebody’s started a blacksmith
shop over here on the island, that’s
what!” remarked Josh.</p>

<p>“Mebbe they’re counting over the ducats
they’ve stolen,” suggested George; but the idea
of silver dollars making such a loud sound as this
as they jingled in a heap, was really so ridiculous
that even Buster chuckled in derision; whereupon
George had to hastily add “joke!”</p>

<p>“Tell you what I think,” observed wise
Herb. “You know they were having some
engine trouble a while back; and I reckon that
mechanic fellow has got busy fixing it up. The
only thing that surprises me is that George here
didn’t recognize something mighty familiar
in the racket. He’s forever making it himself,
so if I didn’t know he was alongside, I’d take
my affidavy that was him right now.”</p>

<p>“Huh! think yourself smart to make fun of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
my twelve-horse power engine, don’t you,
Herb?” he started to say, and would doubtless
have delivered himself of considerably more
along the same lines, only that Jack broke in
by observing:</p>

<p>“All the same, Herb is right, there; for the
man is aboard the boat and working away at
the motor. He’s some machinist, believe me,
from the way he goes about things. And there’s
the other one going aboard too; wonder what
that means?”</p>

<p>Watching they presently saw the younger
fellow come in sight again, and step to the bank
of the island from the power tied-up and anchored
boat.</p>

<p>“Got an armful of blankets?” asserted Josh,
immediately.</p>

<p>“That settles one thing, then,” came from
George.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’re going to make camp ashore,
and pass the night on firm ground,” Jack admitted.
“Perhaps they like the change, as we
do. Plenty of times when you just have to
sleep aboard the boat, you know.”</p>

<p>“And p’raps,” George went on, “we’ll be
trying out my little bit of a scheme, after all.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows,” Jack assured them.</p>

<p>They made themselves as easy as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and took up their vigil, not knowing how long
it might last.</p>

<p>Back and forth the younger fellow went,
until he had carried a great lot of articles, calculated
to induce a comfortable night’s rest
ashore. Then he started in to fix things to
suit him, taking a part of the blankets.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” whispered Jack, to Herb,
who was next, “he’s a greenhorn, as far as
camping goes.”</p>

<p>“Yep, guess he is,” assented the other, although,
if put to the test, Herb might have found
it difficult to explain on what he founded his
belief.</p>

<p>“See where he’s gone and arranged his blankets,”
Jack continued. “There, he’s trying
to see how they feel; and would you look at his
head toward the fire. No experienced camper
ever does that, because it’s his feet that get
cold in the night, so he always has them closest
to the fire.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” agreed Herb, just as though he had
always known that fact, when in truth it had
never occurred to him before.</p>

<p>“He fetched some grub with him the last
time he came!” whispered George, on the other
side of Jack, “and if anybody asked me what
that stood for I’d be likely to say it meant they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
were going to stay on dry land a little while,
till they get that engine working that’s what.”</p>

<p>“Well, that isn’t going to be long,” remarked
Josh in turn as there came a series of explosions
from aboard the boat, that sounded as regularly
as clockwork. “He’s got her working now,
all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Then he must be a crack-a-jack of a mechanic,”
observed George, thoughtfully, as
though a vague idea had come into his head that
it might pay him to get such a man to look over
his engine, given the chance.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t seen any paint&mdash;yet,” remarked
Buster, obstinately.</p>

<p>“Well, what would they want to get busy
with that for at night time?” Josh asked him.
“If they put in tomorrow hiding here on the
island you’ll see enough of paint slingin’ to
suit you, Buster, believe me. They’ll want
to get the boat partly up out of the water on
some skids, using block and tackle to drag her;
and then so change her looks that nobody’ll
recognize her as the same suspicious white boat
that took the bank’s cash away.”</p>

<p>After that they fell silent for some time,
meanwhile continuing to watch the two who
were still objects of concern, not to say suspicion.
The one ashore had crawled under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
his blankets as though bent on getting fixed
cozy for the night. He came out and went
back three separate times. Now it was to
arrange his covering a little differently; and
again it was to draw the blankets back and dig
out a root that must have started to hurt his
back while lying there, as roots have a failing
for doing with campers, especially the big
gnarly ones that have a knob on them&mdash;every
boy knows that without being told.</p>

<p>About the time he finally seemed fixed comfortably
with the fire burning low not very far
from his head the second one came ashore.</p>

<p>“How is she now, Jenks; I heard you give
her a trial spin?” came a voice from among
the collected heap of blankets which the intended
sleeper had drawn over him.</p>

<p>“Workin’ tip-top, sir, right now,” replied
the other; and somehow it seemed to the
listening Jack that there was a vein of deference
in his tones such as might hardly be expected
to be disclosed when one cracksman
addressed another, no matter if it was a Slim
Jim, and a recognized master of the art of
thievery.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve got that thing off our hands,
Jenks,” the unseen one went on, every word
reaching the ears of the listening boys, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
he called out loudly, thinking his voice might be
muffled by the blankets, “and we can take it
easy tomorrow, with the other job, if we conclude
to hide until darkness comes around
again.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir, so we can,” assented the
other, beginning to shift his blankets and make
up his bed in the regulation way.</p>

<p>There was no more said.</p>

<p>Jack, watching Jenks, immediately decided
that the man must have been in the open more
or less, for he seemed to know just how to go
about things; and his head was not toward the
fire either, when he lay down. Still, he did
not attempt to arrange the blaze so that it
would keep up for many hours; perhaps he
thought that since the other had incautiously
placed his head that way it would be folly to
keep the heat going, so as to roast him out.</p>

<p>And then at last both seemed to have successfully
arranged themselves, for there was no
longer any wriggling movements of the blankets
that might stand for uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Think they’re asleep, Jack?” queried Herb,
softly, as he touched the other gently on the
arm.</p>

<p>“If they ain’t they’ll soon be,” muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
George, who had overheard the question and
took it upon himself to answer.</p>

<p>“Wonder how much longer this game’s goin’
to keep up?” grumbled Josh; “my right leg’s
nigh paralyzed as it is, and I’m gettin’ a crick
in my back, Jack, what’s the best word?”</p>

<p>For reply he received a low warning hist that
somehow thrilled Josh, and possibly some of the
others as well. Immediately every one fastened
his eyes on the two bundles of blankets
near the dying fire, as though expecting to see
some upheaval in that quarter; but nothing of
the kind took place.</p>

<p>“What was it, Jack?” whispered Josh, wondering
why the other had given that low warning,
when there seemed to be no sign of trouble in
the hostile camp.</p>

<p>“Something moving over yonder in the bushes;
watch sharp, to the right, now!” was what came
from the Commodore.</p>

<p>“Gee! mebbe a wild animal goin’ to raid the
camp for grub!” Josh suggested.</p>

<p>“More’n likely the same hungry guy that
carried off that ham of ours, that’s what,”
Buster was just heard to say, deep down in his
throat.</p>

<p>Then they lapsed into silence again; though
all this talking had been conducted in such low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
tones, that a short distance away any one would
have taken it for granted that it could only be
the night wind whispering through the branches
of the trees overhead, not yet fully covered
with the fresh green leaves that came with the
spring.</p>

<p>Yes, there certainly was something moving
over there, in the quarter which Jack had indicated.
They could see the bushes beginning to
bend again, but very slowly, as though the intended
intruder tried to exercise great care,
not meaning to arouse the sleepers.</p>

<p>Man or animal, they could not say immediately,
for even when they first caught sight of
the moving figure it was crouched so low that it
could pass for either one or the other, in that
uncertain light.</p>

<p>Every eye was riveted on it, that can be set
down as positive. In fact, just at that minute
all of the watchers seemed to be holding their
very breath, such was their natural condition of
suspense, as well as deep interest.</p>

<p>“Is it a panther, Jack; and have you got
your Marlin ready?” Josh whispered in the
other’s ear.</p>

<p>The only answer Jack made was to kick Josh
on the shins; with that unknown thing creeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
forward it seemed no time to be asking foolish
questions. Josh evidently understood, for he
hushed up immediately.</p>

<p>But then that might have been because all
of them saw about this time that it was a man
and not an animal, for he had raised his head,
in order to take a sharp look toward the spot
where the fire glimmered and the two figures
were huddled in the piles of blankets.</p>

<p>Possibly the low murmur of Josh’s voice had
reached the ears of the intruder, so as to arouse
a slight suspicion; but if so, this must have been
lulled to sleep again immediately he found that
neither of the inanimate figures had changed
position.</p>

<p>But when the man thus partly arose it disclosed
the fact that he was a heavyset sort of a
fellow, wearing a cap and that his face was partly
covered with a beard. It did something more
than this. When he stretched his neck to see
the better a portion of his body was exposed
to view.</p>

<p>Now, it was nothing strange that this unknown
prowler wore a sweater, or that this was a fine
soft gray woolen sweater, of the kind used by
automobile tourists in these days, buttoning
down the front; but it certainly nearly gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Buster Longfellow heart disease when he discovered
on the breast of that same garment the
wonderful blue moon that he had so often
described as marking his lost present, which
he had been suspecting poor innocent Josh of
having purloined!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE MAN WITH THE BLUE MOON SWEATER</small></h2>


<p>Now, it happened that Jack had made this
astonishing discovery even before Buster could
have done so, for he was so much quicker than
the fat boy to observe things, and never had
there been a sweater made just like that one
with the blue moon on its front.</p>

<p>Jack also knew that the chances were Buster
would be apt to say something out loud in his
astonishment at seeing his lost property on the
back of a prowler, possibly the very man who
had stolen their intended supper.</p>

<p>And as the leader of the motor boat boys was
as quick as a flash to act, no sooner had this idea
entered his brain than he stretched out his arm
actually across Herb, and reaching the fat boy,
managed to clasp his hand squarely over his
mouth.</p>

<p>From the fact that Buster’s lips were twitching
at that very second, it seemed evident that he
had just been on the point of giving vent to his
feelings by some such blunt expression as:</p>

<p>“Well, would you see the nerve of that, now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead he was brought to a sense of the necessity
for complete silence; and as Buster was not
at all devoid of common sense he managed to
bottle up his excitement somewhat.</p>

<p>But now the man had dropped down on all
fours again, and seemed to be moving along
with considerable dispatch. Jack had seen that
the fellow had eyes only for the motionless
figures at the fire; and also that something
approaching a grin had broken out on his heavy
face when he saw how inanimate they were.</p>

<p>His movements were certainly suspicious, and
those that would indicate an intention of thievery.
Certainly no honest man would come
stealing into a strange camp in this fashion.</p>

<p>What could he want? If this were the same
rogue who had made way with the food Josh
placed on that flat stone, perhaps he believed
that it would be just as well to strike while the
iron was hot, and there seemed to be abundant
supplies lying around loose. If he were a
shiftless fisherman, such as sometimes used to
gather here on this island, Jack had been told,
why, he might believe that all was fish that came
to his net; and seeing the food that had been
carried ashore, lying so temptingly around,
canned stuff, and all that abundant means could
supply, he was now bent on making a haul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>That was Jack’s first idea, for the man seemed
to be crawling toward the pile of groceries when
discovered. But now he had shifted his course
somewhat, so that it was at a tangent with his
first line of advance. Was he simply trying
to avoid contact with the sleepers, or did he have
some other reason for altering the direction of
his coming?</p>

<p>Jack’s interest began to increase by leaps and
bounds. He realized that perhaps the intruder
might be looking forward to something of far
greater advantage than a mere carrying off of
eatables. Yes, he was heading now toward the
shore where the white motor boat was tied up!
And Jack suddenly recollected that one of his
companions had suggested that the robbers kept
their treasure-trove aboard the craft. That
was after the discovery of the hoax connected
with the buried box.</p>

<p>But then how could this rough fellow have
any suspicion concerning the plunder taken
from the bank? He surely could not, and must
be intending to go aboard simply under the belief
that fatter pickings were to be found on the
little vessel just then totally unguarded.</p>

<p>Now he was at the river bank, with nothing
to interfere with his plan of boarding the tied-up
boat. Of course his progress had been followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
by every one of the six pair of eyes belonging
to the boys hiding in the bushes, and it
would be needless to say that by now all of
them guessed what his destination was.</p>

<p>Jack felt a pair of knuckles industriously
digging at his side which he knew must belong
to George. The impulsive one was in this mute
fashion voicing his desire to know what Jack
meant to do about it; and doubtless hoping that
they would be given permission to make some
sort of move after the thief had fully vanished
over the side of the white boat.</p>

<p>But Jack paid no attention to the nudges. He
was thinking just then what a queer old mix-up
the whole affair was getting to be; when one
robber attempted to ply his trade upon another
of the same sort.</p>

<p>Now they could see the shadowy form passing
from the bank on to the gunwale of the boat.
The fact that the side of the craft chanced to be
so very white did much to throw the climbing
figure out in relief. Then he disappeared and
everything was as it had been; only they knew
an intruder had boarded the boat, and must be
rummaging around in search of something which
doubtless he expected to find there.</p>

<p>Still the two near the dying camp fire had
shown no sign of life. They seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
sound asleep, and utterly unconscious of the
fact that an enemy had crept into their midst,
bent on pillage.</p>

<p>Jack thought fast, and indeed, there was good
reason why he should do so. Should they
attempt to warn the two nestled there amidst
the blankets, and put them wise to the fact that
they were in danger of being robbed? That
would only disclose their presence to the fugitives
from justice, as they had been terming
the owner of the white boat, and his companion
Jenks. And if they were the men who had
looted the bank up at Lawrence, why try and
save their ill-gotten plunder?</p>

<p>Really, it would appear to be just as well
that they let this adroit second thief get the
treasure in his possession, and then proceed to
take it from him in turn. Besides, it might
be policy to reduce the number of those against
whom the boys would have to pit themselves;
and one must be reckoned just the half of two.</p>

<p>That was the way Jack found himself putting
it, as though he had to reduce the whole thing
to argument. And it was surprising how many
different things could force themselves into his
mind in just a brief space of time. He could
imagine the last creeper to have come safely
off the white boat, with the treasure in his possession,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
perhaps even walking close by where
they crouched; then would be given a signal
that must result in his being attacked from every
quarter at once; and surely with six of them to
assist, he must be easily pulled down.</p>

<p>But wait, there was no need of getting so far
afield, when the man seemed to be still busying
himself aboard the white motor boat some way
or other. While they could not see him, it was
noticed that the narrow-beamed boat was
shaking more or less, as though some one were
moving about aboard.</p>

<p>Buster must recognize a very familiar movement
in this, because there was the cranky
Wireless, always ready to accommodate itself to
the activities of any one who had the misfortune
to pass any length of time on board, either
as passenger, crew or skipper.</p>

<p>Should that heavy-set man, called Jenks by
the other, chance to awaken about this time,
perhaps there would be something doing speedily,
for he had all the looks of a stayer in a fight, and
once he detected the presence of the interloper,
woe be to him. But there had not been the
slightest movement to either of the sleepers;
and if the intended robber of thieves was to be
balked in his designs, it looked as though Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and his chums would have to prove themselves
equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>And so Jack’s conclusion seemed to be that
it might pay them to get somewhat closer to the
river bank, so that should the unknown finish
his work aboard, and start to make his escape,
they could head him off the better.</p>

<p>It was not really necessary for him to communicate
all this to each one of his chums.
When they saw him start to make a move they
would understand what was intended, and
govern themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>Jack raised himself to his hands and knees.
Then he commenced to work his way along,
with the tied-up boat as his ultimate destination.</p>

<p>Just as he had anticipated, every one of the
other fellows started in to imitate his actions.
All they wanted was an example, and they were
ready to follow suit. You have seen the whole
flock of sheep follow the bellwether over a low
fence; and that was about the same way George
and Josh and the rest did right then and there.</p>

<p>All went smoothly for a certain length of
time; perhaps as much as three or four minutes
may have passed along. Then something happened
that was certainly not down on the bills;
and coming so unexpectedly must have given
the boys a severe shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Without warning there burst upon the night
air a loud and sonorous “ker-chew!” Why, it
was deep-toned enough to have awakened the
Seven Sleepers of old; and certainly the precious
pair over there by the fire could not help but be
electrified by the explosion.</p>

<p>It was not a thunder clap, though some of the
creeping boys might have so considered, when
first it broke upon their startled hearing. No,
it was only Buster Longfellow sneezing.</p>

<p>This was an old weakness of Buster’s. He was
wont to sneeze on any and all occasions, and
many times in his past history had he been
brought to a knowledge of the fact that it was
a habit calculated to get a fellow into all sorts
of trouble. Remember that time he threatened
to upset George’s boat when one of these fits
happened along? Well, there were now even
more dire possibilities in store for the unlucky
originator of that tremendous sneeze, than he
cared to look in the face.</p>

<p>In the first place it aroused the two at the
fire. They could be seen suddenly sitting up
straight, and looking all around them, as though
half expecting to discover strangers in the camp,
who according to their calculations could have
no business there.</p>

<p>Then a head was seen to rise hurriedly above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the gunwale of the white motor boat, showing
that the fellow who had gone aboard, had been
disturbed in the midst of whatever he was doing.
Of course it was to be expected that he would
spring over the side, and make a streak for it,
intending to find shelter in the covert of nearby
bushes.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort happened.</p>

<p>On the contrary, while he did immediately
expose himself in full view it was to carry out
an entirely different line of energy.</p>

<p>Jack was just in the act himself of standing up
and directing his comrades as to what they
should do in order to cut off the other’s escape,
when he saw there was going to be nothing doing
in that line.</p>

<p>For the man had leaned quickly over the side,
and made a sweep with his hand at the little
hawser holding the boat snug against the bank.
He must have had an exceedingly sharp-bladed
knife there, for it cut through that rope as though
the cable were made of sand. And at the same
moment the white motor boat started to swing
free from the shore of the island.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE RIVER PIRATE</small></h2>


<p>It was all done as quick as a flash, almost.</p>

<p>The unknown man aboard the white motor
boat had no sooner sliced the rope apart, thus
allowing the craft to swing free and begin moving
with the current, always pulling steadily
at it while lying there, than he did something
more.</p>

<p>“Look at him with the push-pole!” whooped
Josh.</p>

<p>“Hey! hold on there! That ain’t your boat.
I’ll have the law on you for stealing!” cried
out the dapper young chap, who had thrown his
blankets aside, and was standing there, shaking
his fist after the bold trespasser.</p>

<p>The big man with him, who had done all the
work on the engine earlier in the night, Jenks,
started to rush toward the landing, as though
he believed in deeds rather than words. But the
fellow who was so coolly making off with their
boat laughed harshly as he plied the push-pole
briskly.</p>

<p>Already had the boat gained a certain momentum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and if allowed to continue as it was
going for another full minute, would be lost to
the owner.</p>

<p>Jack and his five companions had not held
back all this time either. They were at a disadvantage,
being much further away from the
scene of action than those who had been sleeping
near the remains of the fire. Consequently
there was little chance for them to reach the
spot before the man had accomplished his evil
task, and completed the seizure of the white
boat.</p>

<p>Jenks rushed down the shore like a mad bull.
From his actions it seemed as if he contemplated
jumping into the river, and forcing his
way out to the stolen boat in spite of everything.</p>

<p>Indeed, he did push into the water, which
happened to be rather shallow at that point,
and was making a gallant attempt to board the
boat, when suddenly the man dropped his pole,
and held something out toward Jenks that glistened
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Keep back or I’ll shoot!” they heard him
call out.</p>

<p>Jenks possibly did not believe him, for he
kept rushing through the water still; whereupon
<a href="#image01">there came a sharp report, and a flash of flame</a>.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Buster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Jenks had pulled up short, and seemed to be
wavering.</p>

<p>“That was only a warning,” the man aboard
went on to say, angrily; “but try it some more,
and I’ll aim for keeps. You get me, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>All this was plainly seen because of the bright
moon. And while they stood and stared, they
heard the crank of the engine worked, and
immediately the rapid sound of the exhaust told
that Jenks had indeed placed it in splendid
order, much to his regret now.</p>

<p>So the white boat began to speed away. Jack
noticed that instead of keeping on down the
river, the thief was gradually starting to curve
to the right, as though it was his intention to
come around and head up stream. At the
moment he did not realize what this might mean
but a little later it dawned upon him in full force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there was more or less excitement
around that spot.</p>

<p>Jenks came wading ashore again, and holding
his left arm in a way that would indicate that
he had received some sort of a wound at the
time the desperate thief fired at him.</p>

<p>The younger stranger was dancing around in
a furious fashion, and acting so like a simpleton
in his anger that Jack felt ashamed to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that he had once suspected him of being the
slick thief whom the paper called Slim Jim.
Why, this chap was an innocent of the innocents,
just the kind of boy his appearance had
stamped him&mdash;some rich man’s petted darling,
allowed to have a fine boat for a play toy, with
a steady man to run it for him, whom he could
boss around.</p>

<p>All this Jack realized in the brief space of
time that he stood there, surveying the scene,
and hearing the popping of the motor boat’s
exhaust sounding less and less noisy, as the
stolen craft went further and further away from
the island.</p>

<p>And about that time the distracted owner of
the boat seemed to realize that he and Jenks
were not alone. He stared at Jack and his
companions as though unable to understand
how they came there, or if they were really
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>“They said that this miserable island was
haunted,” he exclaimed, “and I’m beginning
to believe it’s so. Who are you, fellows, and
where did you spring from?”</p>

<p>Jack was for taking the bull by the horns.
He had seen all his suspicions concerning these
two swept aside, so that they were no longer
objects of concern in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s too long a story to tell just now,” he
remarked as he approached the other. “We
belong in a town above here, and are having a
little outing on board our three motor boats,
which are tied up not far away. When you
landed we wondered who you were, because
there has been a robbery committed in Lawrence
up the river, and the two yeggs who broke into
the bank were said to have escaped in a white
motor boat with a red band around the gunnel.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” gasped the other, as though
staggered by such astonishing information,
“took us for burglars, did you? I like that,
now. Why, my name’s Algernon Lorrimer,
and my father’s one of the richest men in Minneapolis.
Get that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ve heard of him, all right,” said
Jack. “We’re glad to meet you, Algernon, even
if it is under queer conditions. My name’s
Jack Stormways,” and then he proceeded to
string off the names of his five companions in
rapid-fire order, the other boy bowing politely
at each in turn; evidently Algernon had been
well brought up, and was accustomed to the
usages of good society, even though he might be
only a “stick” aboard a boat, insofar as being
able to help run the same was concerned.</p>

<p>“Glad to make your acquaintance, fellows,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he said, loftily. “I hope you’ll pardon me if I
seem rather out of sorts. Here I am left, high
and dry on this island, with my new boat stolen
by that contemptible rascal. But he’ll be sorry
he ever treated me like this. My father will
have him found out and punished. That boat
cost two thousand dollars just last week. We
were on our first cruise with it, and playing tag
with Chauncey Gregory and his Firefly. They
were to chase us, you know, and the first one
to get to St. Louis without being seen by the
other was to win the race. But we had some
trouble with our engine, though we managed to
fix it in great shape. And now my Saunterer is
stolen by a vile wretch. How could he have
ever come out here on this lonely island; and
what would he want to take such a fine boat for,
when he couldn’t sell it anywhere, without
being arrested?”</p>

<p>Apparently Algernon was “some talker,” as
Josh put it. Once he got started, and he was
like a seven-day clock in action. And Jack
chuckled to think that they had been looking
upon all this as assumed, and that the millionaire’s
pampered boy had been a desperate thief,
playing a little game. It was one of the most
ridiculous happenings that had ever come to the
motor boat chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>And as Algernon was talking a sudden idea
had leaped into Jack’s active mind. This time
it was founded on facts that were absolutely
true, and could be relied upon.</p>

<p>It all hinged on that wonderful sweater belonging
to Buster, and which was so queerly
marked with a blue moon.</p>

<p>Now Jack knew positively that the same
garment had been in the shed where the trio
of motor boats were lying, awaiting the beginning
of the cruise, on the previous evening, for
he had handled it himself. Buster could not
find it when he wanted to wear it later on, and
the rest believed that it had been carelessly left
somewhere in the shop or shed, though as we
have seen, the fat boy suspected Josh of playing
a sly trick on him.</p>

<p>Now the fact that this strange man was
actually wearing the novel sweater was positive
evidence that he must have been in the shop of
the boat builder on the previous night, for some
purpose or other, and had taken the garment
then, perhaps because it looked warm, and he
anticipated a chilly ride down the river.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack had jumped to a conclusion in the
matter. Although his first guess with regard to
the identity of Algernon and Jenks had been a
bad one, he believed he could do much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with this other fellow; and whom he now believed
to be one of the desperate scoundrels
who had broken into the bank at Lawrence.</p>

<p>A lot of things went to point that way; and
Buster’s sweater was the only connecting clue,
as it were. How the men happened to be on
the island, and why one of them was ready to
take chances in stealing some of their food, of
course Jack was hardly in a condition to say
just then. They must have been pretty hungry,
which would indicate that they could not have
had any food aboard their boat at the time they
fled from pursuit. Perhaps some accident had
happened to the craft in which they had come
down the river. That would account for the
fellow stealing the fine new motor boat belonging
to the tenderfoot cruiser, Algernon. It
may have taken his fancy for some reason or
other; perhaps because it happened to resemble
their own craft, now disabled.</p>

<p>Strange how things will fly through the mind
at times, when there is any cause for excitement.
Jack thought of a score of facts calculated to
back up his theory, even while he was standing
there, with the throbbing of the lost boat still
sounding faintly in his ears.</p>

<p>Whatever of mystery there might be about
the actions of the man who had run off with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Saunterer, this was really no time for explanations,
or to try and figure things out. Later on,
when it was all over, and they could sit comfortably
beside a camp fire, it would be fun to piece
things together, and find out just what had influenced
all these events to come about.</p>

<p>“Boys,” Jack said, turning to his friends,
“I’ve just come to the conclusion that we’ve
run across one of those bank thieves after all.”</p>

<p>“You mean the chap who stole my boat?”
ejaculated Algernon, “goodness gracious! who
would have thought now, that I’d come in
contact with such desperate characters in my
little run down-river. And he shot my man,
too; see, Jenks is getting one of your friends,
to wrap a rag around his arm. This is thrilling.
It makes my blood run cold to think that I was
actually so close to a real burglar. Won’t I have
the story to tell Chauncey, though? But how
am I ever to get off this island, and try to recover
my boat?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to us, Algernon,” said Jack,
quietly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Jack’s taken the job on!” shouted
Josh, excitedly, “and when he says he’ll see it
through, you can bet your boots he means
business. What are we going to do about it,
Jack?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>All eyes were of course turned upon the Commodore.
In this critical time they seemed to
depend on him to lead the way out of the maze.
Jack would know what to do; that was what
the rest always said to each other, as soon as
any serious difficulty arose.</p>

<p>And Jack simply raised his hand as if to call
for silence, as he said:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, fellows, I want to listen to
what those rapid-fire explosions aboard the
white motor boat are telling me. They’re
getting louder again, you notice, with every
minute that passes.”</p>

<small>READY FOR TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>“Jack, you’re right,” remarked George, after
the whole of them had stood there, listening
eagerly for a minute or so. “That sounds
louder all the time.”</p>

<p>“P’raps the wind’s shifted?” suggested Josh.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it has, even a little bit,”
Herb observed, on his part.</p>

<p>“Then what d’ye think it means?” asked
Bumpus, who was just as much interested as
any one of his boat-mates.</p>

<p>“Why, he changed his course, that’s what,”
declared Josh.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s it, eh?” Bumpus went on to say,
“and as he was running up-stream before, why,
that means he’s coming down now.”</p>

<p>“Seems like it, Bumpus,” admitted George.</p>

<p>“Why?” the fat boy kept asking; for when
anything puzzled him he never gave his comrades
any peace until they had explained the
particulars; for Bumpus could be a standing
interrogation point when he chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you’ve got me,” admitted Josh,
“’cause I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t doing that just for fun, you believe,
don’t you? He’s got a card up his sleeve, as
they say; and means to play it on us. Started
up the river in the beginning just to use a little
time, and pull the wool over our eyes, fellers.
Now he comes a-spinnin’ down again in a little
different direction. Why? Again I wait to
hear some wise head say it,” and Bumpus assumed
an expectant attitude as he went on in
this manner.</p>

<p>“Jack, c’n you answer him?” Herb questioned;
for, as usual they began to turn toward
the Commodore at such a time, just as though
he might be an unabridged dictionary, and able
on any and all occasions to supply the crowd
with information.</p>

<p>“Well, if, as we seem to believe, this bold
scamp is one of those bank robbers, there’s only
one way open for him to escape from any pursuers,
and that’s down the Mississippi,” Jack
started to say; when George uttered a sudden
mild whoop.</p>

<p>“I’ve got it!” he cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, then, George,” said Buster,
eagerly, “and suppose you tell us before you
burst. The cooper that put hoops around your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
barrel didn’t fasten ’em any too tight, believe
me. Now, all at once, and have it over with&mdash;why
should that feller turn around, and start
back this way again, after getting safe off?”</p>

<p>“Why, because he suddenly remembered that
he had a chum somewhere on this same old
island,” George announced, triumphantly;
“how’s that, Jack?”</p>

<p>Jack patted him on the back approvingly.</p>

<p>“Looks like you’d guessed it the first crack,
George,” he declared. “Yes, whether he forgot
that fact for a few minutes, or has been playing
a little game to make us believe he was aiming
to go up-river, there’s no doubt but what he’s
heading back now so’s to pick the other one up.
These sort of fellows stand by each other
through thick and thin, you know; that’s their
best quality, always.”</p>

<p>“And Jack,” piped up Buster just then,
“don’t you think that there might be something
else adrawin’ him back here&mdash;f’r instance, that
stuff they took away from the busted Lawrence
bank?”</p>

<p>“Hurray for Buster; he’s all right; and this
time he’s struck a brilliant idea! Great head,
old man, better be careful of your brains after
this. You’re waking up at last; ain’t he, Jack?”
but Buster did not deign to pay any attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to all this talk on the part of Josh, because he
knew the other must be secretly envious of him.</p>

<p>“That’s really a bright thought, Buster,” admitted
Jack, immediately. “This fellow might
be ready to stick by his crony; but we know he’s
bound not to desert the plunder; and that must
still be on the island here, aboard their boat,
wherever they’ve got her hidden. You know,
boys, we kind of thought they’d hide here, and
try to paint the boat some dark color, so it
wouldn’t give them away; for every sheriff and
marshal down-river way will be on the watch
for a white boat with a red streak along the
gunnel.”</p>

<p>“Mercy me! and think of the warm times I’ll
be apt to have after this, on the way to St. Louis,”
remarked Algernon, throwing up his white
hands in dismay.</p>

<p>“That is, if ever you’re lucky enough to get
your boat back again,” reminded Josh, who
rather like to “nag” such a dandified fellow as
Algernon and see him squirm.</p>

<p>“All of you noticed the fellow was wearing
that sweater with the blue moon on its front,”
Jack continued to say, as he explained matters
more fully, “and we know that belongs to Buster
here; also that it was in that boathouse of
the builder where we left our three boats last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
night, when we locked up; because I handled
it myself. Don’t you see what that means,
boys?”</p>

<p>“That man was in there; is that it, Jack?”
George asked.</p>

<p>“He certainly must have been, else how could
he get my sweater?” demanded Buster, swelling
with importance, since his name was bound to be
mentioned in connection with this affair every
time the story was told, and all on account of
that new and remarkable garment which he had
lost.</p>

<p>“But if they had looted the bank up at Lawrence,
tell me why they’d be foolish enough to
land in our town, and start in breaking open
stores and boat building establishments? Seems
funny business for a pair of smart yeggs?”
Josh asked.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Jack, “go back a little. Suppose
now, while they were coming down the
river, that idea about the paint just bobbed up
in their heads, and it seemed such a clever scheme
that they wanted to kick themselves because
they hadn’t just thought of it before, and had
some of the right kind of stuff on hand. So
when they came to our town, this fellow, who
must be a pretty bold sort of chap, we know,
made up this plan to sneak ashore, break into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
some paint shop, and get away with a supply.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m on to what you mean, Jack,”
George hastened to remark, “and when he
struck the boat-yard of Mr. Kedge, he just up
and thought he’d sure find paint in there, because
it’s used on boats. And as Buster had
left his new sweater lying around loose, like he
always does with his things, why, Mr. Burglar,
feeling the night air on the river a bit cold, just
swiped the same. That’s as plain as the nose
on Josh’s face here.”</p>

<p>“Just you let my nose alone,” muttered Josh,
like a flash, “it may be a little bigger’n yours,
but it knows how to keep out of other people’s
business.”</p>

<p>“Then you think, do you, Jack,” George
went on, “that something might have happened
to their boat, and crippled the same, so that they
put in here some time yesterday morning, if you
can call it that, though this is still the same day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it looks as if they needed a new boat
to continue their voyage down the river; and
seeing this fine chance, while Algernon and
Jenks were fast asleep, this man started to sneak
it away. He might have done it, and never a
thing would they have known until morning,
only for the sneeze that Buster here gave.”</p>

<p>“See that,” cried the fat boy, triumphantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“you all have poked heaps of fun at me because
I sneeze so much; but here’s a time that it
paid right handsomely.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Buster,” said George, quickly, “when
it comes to waking people up, the flock of geese
that once saved Rome from a night attack didn’t
have anything on you, with your fine sneeze.
I give you my word, you’d arouse a whole city,
once you let loose.”</p>

<p>“Bah! just jealous, that’s all; but don’t
you dare to imitate me, because I give you warning
right now I’m going to get that sneeze copyrighted,
that’s what,” Buster went on to declare
emphatically.</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” remarked Herb, “there’s a
heap of engines getting into trouble about now;
George has his spell; then Jenks had to work on
the one in their boat; and now we suspect that
these runaway robbers had a breakdown of their
own.”</p>

<p>“That shows you that I ain’t the only one
that gets into a mess with motor trouble,”
George hastened to tell them.</p>

<p>“But arrah, now, phat arre we goin’ to do
about this same broth of a bye comin’ back till
the island for frind?” Andy wanted to know just
then.</p>

<p>“Sensible of you to ask that, Andy,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Jack, “because it might be possible for
us to surprise the pair, if only we could guess
about where he meant to land along the shore.”</p>

<p>“Whee! is that what’s on the bill, Jack?”
exclaimed Buster, “then how glad I am that
you’ve got that splendid little Marlin gun of
yours handy. If there’s going to be a scrap,
every one of us ought to pick up some sort of
club, so’s to make a respectable showing. And
right here I see one I’m going to cabbage on
the spot.”</p>

<p>“Which spot?” queried Josh; but no one paid
the slightest attention to jokes at such a critical
moment.</p>

<p>“Listen again, boys,” ordered Jack, “and
see if you can tell whether he’s coming down this
side of the island, or the other one; because that
would mean a whole lot for us.”</p>

<p>For a minute no one uttered a sound. The
quick pulsations of the exhaust belonging to the
stolen motor boat could be plainly heard, for the
night was as still as death, all but that murmur
of the breeze among the treetops on the island,
and perhaps the gentle lapping of the river on
the rocks along the shore.</p>

<p>“I think he’s started down the other side,
Jack,” said George.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Josh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t seem to be able to guess,” complained
Buster, “one time I think it is the other
side of the island and then again seems to me
he’s heading right back the way he went.”</p>

<p>“Other side of me,” Herb went on to say,
wishing to be counted.</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s me ijee to a dot, so ’tis,” declared
the Irish lad, vehemently.</p>

<p>“Other side have it, five to one,” Jack went
on, somehow forgetting that there were others
present, though for that matter Algernon was
so bewildered by all the strange things that were
happening, he did not seem able to gather his
wits together, and Jenks was apparently quite
satisfied to leave the whole matter of the attempted
recovery of the motor boat to the
charge of these six wide-awake young chaps
who had shown themselves to be so clever;
though if it ever came to a crisis, doubtless the
sturdy machinist would be only too willing to
throw himself into the fight, and do his full
duty.</p>

<p>“There, it’s stopped now, boys!” cried George
suddenly.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” declared Jack, “and as near
as I can place it, seems as if the last sound came
from across the island, too, perhaps a little further
up. Come on, everybody, and let’s see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
if we can push right through the place. The
trees are scattered, and the moon shows bright
enough to give us some light.”</p>

<p>“We’re off!” exclaimed Josh, exultantly, for
he liked to be in action.</p>

<p>“Who’s afraid?” demanded Buster, waving
the big billet of wood he had picked up, as though
anxious to do some service with the same.</p>

<p>“Keep still, everybody, and look where you’re
going,” warned Jack, leading off.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>JUST A MINUTE TOO LATE</small></h2>


<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Buster, presently,
and the others heard more or less of a loud
crashing, which would seem to indicate that the
fat boy, who was always rather clumsy in his
movements, had stumbled and fallen amidst
the impediments that sprinkled their course.</p>

<p>“Hurt, Buster?” questioned Herb, who was
close behind.</p>

<p>“Naw, only knocked a little skin off my
knees, I guess. Better luck next time,” was
the cheerful reply, as the unfortunate one
scrambled to his feet, and again resumed his
forward progress.</p>

<p>When Jack and his five mates started off,
the man Jenks, and his employer, Algernon
Lorrimer, apparently did not mean to be left
entirely in the lurch. They were in the group
now pushing through the wooded part of the
island, and trying to surmount the many difficulties
that beset their course.</p>

<p>Algernon had about as much trouble as Buster
to navigate safely; now it was some unnoticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
log that threatened to trip him up, and again a
hanging vine tried to choke him outright.
Jenks hovered near by, ready to come to the
rescue of his employer should the latter succeed
in getting into a severe pinch. As Josh afterward
said in commenting on this solicitude on
the part of the machinist, perhaps Jenks had
not been paid his week’s wages as yet, and
wanted to make sure he would have an employer
to whom he could look for the expected cash.</p>

<p>One thing proved of considerable assistance,
and this was the moon. Battered though it
might be, and with one side partly gone, still
the faithful old sky lantern was able to give out
a considerable amount of silvery light.</p>

<p>“Lucky we’ve got that moon, let me tell you,”
grunted Buster, as he continued to boom along,
making enough noise, so Josh declared, to warn
the whole neighborhood of their coming.</p>

<p>“Some people’d need three moons to get
along half way decent,” was what Josh declared
from some point close by.</p>

<p>“Hush!” Jack remarked, and at that they
all fell quiet again.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was no child’s play making their
way through the dense growth that covered
the main part of the island. Even in the daytime
they would have had more or less trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in accomplishing such a task; and when attempting
it with only the deceptive moonlight
as a source of illumination, the task became
doubly difficult.</p>

<p>Once Jack called a brief halt.</p>

<p>It was his idea to try and ascertain whether
there were any sounds ahead, such as might
indicate the presence of busy workers, getting
their belongings from the boat that was about
to be abandoned to the one that had just fallen
into their possession, through a stroke of luck,
backed up by daring.</p>

<p>It might be in the shape of voices, a cough,
or any sort of sound that would betray the
presence of human beings; why, even a sneeze,
such as that famous one of Buster, would do the
business.</p>

<p>But somehow nothing of the sort seemed to
come to their strained hearing; at any rate
most of them failed to catch such a welcome
sound. Yet when Jack bade them start on
again, lowering his voice to a thrilling whisper
almost, it seemed as if he felt a new confidence,
showing that he believed he had heard something
or other.</p>

<p>Instead of getting better the nearer they drew
to the other side of the little island that had such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a bad name, it seemed as though conditions
steadily became worse.</p>

<p>Buster and Algernon simply could not hold
up to the pace set by such agile chaps as Jack,
George, Andy and Josh, so that they were
gradually but surely falling back, and being
put out of the race.</p>

<p>Herb was not much better, for it was never
a habit of the easy-going skipper of the solid
old Comfort to hurry more than he could reasonably
help.</p>

<p>But then probably it would not matter so
much after all. There were still five in the
front rank, for Jenks had now forged alongside
the others, thinking he might best serve his
master by trying to recover the boat, rather
than standing by to pick him up in case he fell.
And more than that, there was Jack handling
that reliable Marlin of his in a fashion that
seemed to speak volumes for his intentions,
once he sighted the enemy.</p>

<p>When excitement rules the camp it is wonderful
how many things can be crowded into a
small space of time. People seem to pass
through a lifetime in a few minutes, providing
events come tumbling over one another, helter-skelter
like.</p>

<p>Now, when they came to figure upon it later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
on, the motor boat chums were of the opinion
that even under such adverse conditions they
could not have been more than six or seven
minutes in passing through the wooded center of
the island. It was only a small affair at best,
and by daylight could have been crossed in
much less time. And yet there was Buster,
for instance, who must have been laboring under
the impression that fully half an hour had already
passed since they first started to break
into the thick growth, and butt up against all
these crazy obstacles&mdash;the logs that would get
under a fellow’s feet, the encircling loops of
dangling wild grape-vines; the trees that bobbed
up most unexpectedly, and tried to knock one’s
brains out, and a lot of other things along the
same line “too numerous to mention.”</p>

<p>Of course none of them gave much heed to
what their conduct would be when they managed
to overtake the enemy.</p>

<p>That would have to be left pretty much to
accident. Perhaps some of the boys, under the
belief that they must present quite a hostile
appearance, with all sorts of clubs and cudgels
in evidence, not to speak of that gun Jack carried,
fancied that the two burglars would take
to flight at sight of the advancing legion. But
Jack, and perhaps Herb also, did not delude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
themselves with this expectation; for they could
remember just how that fellow aboard the stolen
boat had warned Jenks off, and even wounded
him in the arm when he refused to stop short.</p>

<p>They set him down as a dangerous character,
which he undoubtedly must have been, to have
carried out the bold programme connected with
the looting of the up-river bank.</p>

<p>At any rate, they must be getting close to the
other side of the island now, for there was a
perceptible slope downward, and this must
mean the crest had been left behind.</p>

<p>Yes, and sure enough, the trees were getting
less dense, though the brush might be as thick
as ever. Jack hoped for one thing that luck
would favor them, and allow of their breaking
out upon the little beach at just the exact spot
where the two men were working.</p>

<p>At the same time he did not feel any too
sanguine of success, for which there were numerous
reasons. Surely the two thieves must be
aware of the fact that the pack was pushing
toward them, for there was plenty of noise
accompanying their forward progress.</p>

<p>And knowing this, would it not be the easiest
thing for them to gauge their time of flitting
by the closeness of the coming host? Jack
thought so, even while still exerting himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the uttermost in order to get to the shore as
speedily as possible.</p>

<p>Ah! now he could see more light ahead, which
told in so many words that they must be close
to the river again. Their troubles were behind
them now; that is, insofar as they concerned
navigating the dense jungle that covered the
island of the bad name.</p>

<p>Those still ahead would be of an entirely different
nature, and might consist of running up
against the desperate thieves.</p>

<p>Just then Jack heard a voice, a very gruff
voice, which he recognized as belonging to the
man who had run off with the white boat.</p>

<p>“That all, Jim?”</p>

<p>The speaking of that name thrilled Jack, for
only too well did he remember that it was
mentioned in the newspaper article describing
the robbery; and if he had had the slightest
doubt before as to the identity of the precious
pair, it was now a thing of the past.</p>

<p>If the man addressed made any sort of reply
Jack failed to catch it. He hoped, however, that
it would be of a negative character&mdash;that they
might still have something more to do; because
Jack had located the voice, and was of the impression
that it came from a little further up
the narrow beach. They had come fairly close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the spot where the transfer of belongings
was being made, but did not hit on it exactly.
And it is an old saying that a miss is as good as
a mile; at any rate it would likely prove such
in this case.</p>

<p>And so they presently burst out of the cover,
and found themselves looking on the moonlit
surface of the flowing Mississippi again.</p>

<p>Jack, Jenks, George and Josh had somehow
come out in a clump, with Andy close at their
heels. None of them more than cast a fleeting
glance out on the dancing water, for they could
see immediately that there was nothing calculated
to interest them there.</p>

<p>Jack immediately turned up the beach, and
started to sprint, for it was open here, and the
absence of obstacles offered them a splendid
chance to do something worth while.</p>

<p>There happened to be a little point setting
out just above, on which grew some stunted
trees and considerable brush. This helped to
make a cove, perhaps something like the one
which the boys had selected as their harbor,
and in which the three motor boats rested
snugly even then.</p>

<p>And as the two fugitive thieves had chanced
to come down that side of the island they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
have picked this out for a stopping-place, where
they could hide their craft.</p>

<p>Rapidly did the running Jack, backed up by
his allies, near this point of land. Once it was
reached, and he believed he would be able to
see what lay beyond; though somehow Jack
did not appear to entertain any doubt as to
the nature of this discovery.</p>

<p>He had already reached its outer edge, and
in another ten seconds must have been able
to push directly through, when, just as he feared,
he heard sounds that announced the finish of
that stage of the game.</p>

<p>The loud crackle of a motor’s exhaust broke
the silence; and from the rapidity with which
it worked he knew that the engine had been
started at almost full speed.</p>

<p>“Oh! rats!” burst out George, who had been
doing his best to get alongside Jack, and succeeded
too, “they’ve got away from us!”</p>

<p>They kept on running, however, and speedily
broke through the fringe of shrubbery that shut
off their view. As they did so it was to hear
a loud hoarse laugh, that came rolling in from
the water, and to see a white boat rushing away
over the glistening surface of the river.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>IN HOT PURSUIT</small></h2>


<p>“It’s all off!” grunted Josh, evidently vastly
disappointed by the outcome of their adventure.</p>

<p>“Yes, they’ve given us the slip!” declared
Jack, who was already trying to think up some
new plan whereby they might further harrass
the bold thieves who had thus far carried things
all their own way.</p>

<p>“How’d you come to let ’em go?”</p>

<p>This from the panting Buster, and he really
meant it, too, which was the strangest part of it
all; he had come rumbling along like an ice-wagon,
as Josh was accustomed to saying, swinging
that long club of his in a way that was as
dangerous to friends as foes.</p>

<p>“Huh! let ’em!” Josh went on to say, mockingly.
“I like that, now, sure I do. As if we
had anything to do with their skipping out.
They were ready to flew the coop when they
heard us a-comin’, and only had to start the
engine. Jenks, here he got that fixed a little
too soon. If he’d only let her go till morning
he’d not be minus a boat now, see?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>All of which was true, but nobody sucked any
consolation out of it. When a horse has been
stolen, how little the unlucky owner cares when
some neighbors come along and show him how
he might have avoided his loss; what he thinks
of most of all is the matter of getting the lost
animal back again into his barn.</p>

<p>And Jack was built that way. He seldom
spent any time mourning over the milk that was
spilt; but immediately proceeded to try and
remedy conditions.</p>

<p>One thing sure, if ever they hoped to give
these fellows any further trouble, it would not
be accomplished by sitting down, and trying
to discover why they could not have navigated
that little patch of timber faster; or pushed
through at a more direct line, so as to have saved
that fatal angle.</p>

<p>The mill will never again grind with the water
that is past&mdash;how frequently Jack could remember
hearing his teacher in school say that; and
he had often applied it to his own actions.</p>

<p>No, the robbers were done with that island,
and had also abandoned their own boat, for it
could be seen tied up there, just ahead. If they
were to be met again it must be on the river.</p>

<p>That would mean a hot pursuit on the part
of the motor boat boys; and this was what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Jack was turning over so quickly in his mind
while he stood there looking out after the disappearing
craft.</p>

<p>“Oh! they left it after all!” exclaimed Algernon,
as he too came up, considerably the worse
for wear, because of the frequent arguments he
had had with various unseen branches and logs
and such things, in his hasty run.</p>

<p>“He thinks that white boat is his,” exclaimed
Josh, pointing as he spoke, “but that’s all
wrong, Algernon, and you’re off your trolley,
sure. They had one of the same color, if not
as good a boat as yours; and they’ve kindly
left it for you, with their compliments. That
was about what he meant when he shouted
across the water, you know.”</p>

<p>“Jack, what are you thinking about now?”
demanded George, who knew from the signs
that the other was turning some sort of idea
over in that active mind of his.</p>

<p>“I was wondering whether we wanted to take
another turn with these fellows, that’s all,”
replied Jack, immediately.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;they’ve cleared out, you know!” said
Buster, blankly, as he looked over the bright
surface of the river, as though wondering however
a fellow was going to walk on the water.</p>

<p>“Well, haven’t we got boats to follow them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with?” demanded Josh, who was quicker-witted
than his stout chum.</p>

<p>“And one of ’em a crack-a-jack for speed,”
added George, proudly.</p>

<p>“When it’s going, you mean, George,” corrected
Josh; at which sly thrust the party indicated
simply curled his lip, and disdained to
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever we decide to do, the sooner
we settle the matter the better,” remarked
Jack, impatiently, something rather uncommon
with him.</p>

<p>“Sure thing, because they’re putting up a
hefty run of it right now, and can do it right
along with that boat,” added Josh.</p>

<p>“What speed can she make, Algernon?”
queried George.</p>

<p>“Fifteen miles an hour when she’s run by
one that knows how to handle her; but by
myself I could never beat eleven at the best,”
came the frank admission, which told just why
he had hired the mechanician to accompany
him in his run down river in competition with
another “chappie” who also owned an expensive
boat.</p>

<p>“Huh! I have had eighteen, and I think
nearly twenty out of mine,” said George, trying
to seem as though he were not boasting, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
simply telling the plain truth, “and I think
she could do that last, with the current to help
out. So you see we’d be apt to come up on
those fellows hand over fist. All of you could
pile aboard the Wireless with me, and given an
hour or so, I reckon we’d bring up alongside
your stolen property, Algernon.”</p>

<p>At that there was a scornful outbreak from
Buster.</p>

<p>“Glory, don’t I see this whole bunch aboard
your Wireless, though? It’d be a sight to make
a feller weep, the way they’d have to sit in the
middle, and never so much as wink an eye for
fear they’d turn the speed boat upside-down.
Excuse me from being in the party, George. I
like your boat all right&mdash;from a distance. If I
had company I’d rather stay on this blessed
old island than get on the Wireless with such a
crowd as this. Please let me go with you, Herb,
if I have to be taken along.”</p>

<p>“Sure we will,” said George, cheerfully, “and
only too glad of the chance. But if we’re going
to do any chasing after that runaway it’s time
we made a start.”</p>

<p>“Then come on, everybody!” cried Jack,
once more starting away on a run, and this time
following the beach down toward the lower end
of the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole eight of them were immediately
in motion. As before, Buster and Algernon
quickly fell behind, though they persisted manfully,
and meant to come up before the boats
could be poled out of the cove and the start
made.</p>

<p>Jack was even then and there fixing things
in his mind, so that there would be no confusion
once they started. He decided that as Herb
would be hopelessly distanced by the other two
boats, and could not be depended on to assist
in any way, if he started at all he should take
aboard as his crew Buster and Algernon; for
they could not be expected to prove of any
great assistance, should matters come to a conflict
of any kind. In fact, Jack would feel
more comfortable with the fat boy missing, for
Buster so often upset all calculations by some
ill-advised if well-meant play.</p>

<p>The others could be apportioned to the Tramp
and the Wireless; with three of them keeping
Jack company, Jenks one of the number, as he
promised to be a valuable ally when the finish
came around.</p>

<p>Running along the open beach was not anything
so difficult as trying to make progress
through all that wild jungle; and in an exceedingly
brief space of time the familiar cove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
loomed up, with its attendant boats, all tied up
snugly to convenient trees, and in deep water
at that, which prevented any possibility of
their getting aground by a sudden fall of the
river during the night, as sometimes happened.</p>

<p>Each skipper made directly for his own boat
the moment he reached the scene. It was no
time to think of taking down the beloved khaki-colored
tent; if Herb did think it worth while
to tag after the others, then things on the island
would have to look after themselves until such
time as the boys could return. And just when
this would be, not even Jack could so much as
guess at this early stage in the expected chase.</p>

<p>Although doubtless more or less excited,
neither George nor Jack seemed apt to make a
serious blunder in the start. They clambered
aboard their respective boats and meanwhile
Jack was shouting directions:</p>

<p>“Andy, you go with George, while Josh and
Jenks will come aboard here. And be quick
to cast off, and get the push poles handy, so
we won’t be wasting time. George, for once
you’ve got to promise me on your honor not to
run ahead. There are only five of us, and we’ll
need every hand against such hard cases. Remember
now, I’m expecting you to keep alongside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The Tramp can overtake that boat all
right, never fear.”</p>

<p>George said he would try and do just as the
Commodore said. At the same time they knew
how great a disappointment it must be to the
reckless chap to have to give such a promise;
for George was no coward, whatever other shortcomings
might be placed against him; and given
half a chance he would have readily hurled himself
at the two fugitive burglars with any sort
of backing.</p>

<p>Everybody worked with the utmost haste.</p>

<p>Why, it seemed as though they had hardly
gained a footing on the boats before both
hawsers were cast loose, and the push poles
could be heard splashing in the water.</p>

<p>The sound thrilled every one of them; for
there may be times when even such a simple
thing as water splashing seems to give warning
of serious times coming. And with such desperate
men as the two bank thieves to overhaul
and perhaps capture, surely Jack and his
chums had a “a hard nut to crack,” as Josh
expressed it.</p>

<p>As soon as the first boat, which happened to
be the Tramp, was well out of the sheltered nook,
Jack gave the crank a turn, and with a whirr
the engine started to working. He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
took charge, for no one knew so well as he how
to get the best that was in that motor in action.</p>

<p>Jack was a bit nervous concerning the other
boat. It was a toss-up as to whether the
machinery of the “freaky” Wireless could be
made to start, just when it was of the utmost
importance, for George never knew a thing
about it, and always approached the subject
with his heart in his mouth, so to speak.</p>

<p>So all of them held their breath when they
saw him get ready to give the crank its customary
whirl.</p>

<p>Then all at once there broke out the welcome
sound of the explosions that told them the story.
Wireless stock went up fifty per cent just then;
Wireless was going to be good, and behave!</p>

<p>And so the two motor boats carrying the
determined little band of intended pursuers
swung out upon the broad and heaving bosom
of the mighty Mississippi, and headed south.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE MOONLIGHT CHASE</small></h2>


<p>Doubtless those boys would never be apt to
forget that chase on the river, even though in
times to come they might have a part in many
other exciting scenes.</p>

<p>The moon was very bright at this hour, not
a cloud dimming its lustre; and upon the water
objects could be seen for quite some distance
away. Although these might not be as distinct
as in the daytime; still, if it was a moving boat,
any one could recognize familiar features about
it. And should it happen to be a peculiar boat,
or one that was painted snow white, surely they
could tell it, once they chanced to come within
a certain radius.</p>

<p>George was of course fidgety.</p>

<p>That old spirit of wanting to let loose, and
shoot away at the very top of speed of which
his high-powered motor was capable, must be
gripping the boy, for it is hard to make one
of his impulsive temperament act in reason.</p>

<p>But Jack was bound that both boats must keep
in touch all the time, and that George should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hold his “bucking broncho” engine, as Buster
called it, in sufficiently to avoid leaving the
Tramp behind.</p>

<p>There were lots of good reasons for this, too.</p>

<p>In the first place Jack knew only too well that
on most occasions when George had had trouble
with his engine, it was when he was playing all
sorts of pranks with it, taking chances, in the
hope of causing his boat to make a record for
the class to which it belonged. And if he were
compelled to moderate his speed just a little,
there would be a far better opportunity for him
to keep right along to the finish.</p>

<p>Then again, this was no good-natured race
intended to test the racing abilities of the two
rival boats. Jack had always admitted frankly
enough that if the Wireless only behaved herself,
she was in a class by herself, insofar as the
other boats of the fleet were concerned. The
only trouble was, that six times out of seven
she insisted on “cutting up” just when George
was congratulating himself that he had finally
conquered that turbulent spirit.</p>

<p>They would, provided they caught up with
the stolen Saunterer, find themselves pitted
against a couple of bad men, who would not
hesitate at anything in order to escape with
their stolen plunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>And that was the main reason why Jack had
insisted upon George binding himself to an
agreement to stay by the others, come what
would. Why, he was that reckless, that, should
he overtake the fugitive thieves, with only Andy
back of him, chances were he would dash at
them, and somebody was bound to get hurt,
probably George himself.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going along nicely,
after they had gotten well away from the island.
Jack wondered whether Herb would insist on
following after them in his slow boat, or stay
by the camp. Perhaps finding that Buster
and Algernon were both eager to get on the move,
no matter if they could not hope to arrive in
time to lend a helping hand, Herb might make
the start.</p>

<p>“Josh, can you see the island still?” the skipper
of the Tramp called out, for he was himself
too busy watching how his machine worked to
take his eyes off it; and then, again, what was
the use, when he could get the information
second-hand just as well.</p>

<p>“Yep, though it’s getting kind of faint now,
Jack,” came the reply. “You see, this here
moonlight ain’t all it’s cracked up to be. I’ve
proved it, too. ’Nother feller’d me we made a
wager that we could tell anybody half a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
away; then we went outside to prove it! My
conscience! there was a black thing in the
country road just about sixty yards away; he
said it looked like a bear, and I was just dead
certain ’twas a cow a-lyin’ down. Well, we
walked up to it, and what d’ye think, it was
only an old stump after all.”</p>

<p>“Look as close as you can, and tell me if you
see anything of another boat coming out,”
Jack went on, as soon as he could work a few
words in; for when Josh felt the inclination to
tell one of his little stories, nothing in all creation
could stop him, unless some one threw a
lump of mud squarely into his open mouth,
as once happened when he was in swimming;
and even then, as soon as he had managed to get
rid of it, he had gone on deliberately, “As I was
a-sayin’&mdash;&mdash;” and so on.</p>

<p>“Why,” he went on to remark, dubiously,
“I c’n see somethin’ a-movin’ over there, somethin’
dark, too, and just in the same place we
came out of; but whether it’s a boat, say, Jack,
don’t ask me to take my affidavy, for I won’t,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I won’t ask you, because I’m sure now it
must be a boat, and of course Comfort, with the
rest of the crowd aboard,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“But shucks! everything’ll be over, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
shouting, when that tub comes along. What’s
the use in Herb startin’ at all, Jack?”</p>

<p>“He had that privilege,” returned the skipper.
“I didn’t just want to tell him he had ought
to stay by the camp, to look after things. And
besides, there’s our new friend, Algernon, of
course he’ll be just as anxious as anything to
know as soon as he can whether we’ve recovered
his Saunterer or not. But I guess you don’t
see anything of that moving thing, now, eh,
Josh?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, she’s blotted out; and I could
crack my eyes lookin’ without getting a peep,”
replied Josh, immediately he had looked again.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s forget all about Herb, and the
rest from now on, because there’s little chance
that they’ll have anything to do with the finish
of the race. George is holding in pretty well,
you see, Josh. He can put a crimp in that speed
mania, when he wants to.”</p>

<p>“But gee! listen to him growling, would you?”
remarked the other, with a dry chuckle, for he
dearly loved to see George held under Jack’s
thumb, for the skipper of the Wireless was so
boastful most of the time. “I pity poor old
Andy havin’ to play crew for such a bear with a
sore head. Wouldn’t surprise me a whit, Jack,
if the Wireless man just found he couldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
stand bein’ held in, and let go for all he’s worth,
shootin’ up ahead like fun.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re way off there, Josh; you heard
George give me his word; and no matter what
other faults George may have, he never goes
back on his promises. That’s his best point.
I’d as soon take his word as lots of fellows’
binding written agreement.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s so, Jack,” said Josh,
slowly, for he wanted to be fair toward his impulsive
chum; and in spite of his many faults,
these comrades, tried and true, loved George
Rollins; strange, but impulsive, hot-tempered
people always make more and warmer friends
than cold, calculating ones, no matter how much
these latter show themselves to be honest and
true.</p>

<p>For some little time they continued to shove
along down the river, with both boats doing
splendidly. Just how many miles an hour they
were making Jack could not say positively; but
he thought it must be in the neighborhood of
fifteen.</p>

<p>George called out a number of times, and
begged the other skipper to do something more
than just crawl. It seemed to be a painful experience
to the captain of the Wireless, and yet when
he was taken to task later on for his impatience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and made to see how well his engine had behaved
when not constantly meddled with, and pushed
to its utmost limit, George candidly admitted
that Jack’s plan was by long odds the best for
all concerned, indeed, the only one they could
have followed, under the circumstances.</p>

<p>They were certainly putting the miles behind
them as they kept on flying down with the
current. Jack had to figure it out, so as to see
about what sort of a lead the fugitive white boat
had on them.</p>

<p>He could give something of a guess as to
about how many minutes had elapsed between
the time the other craft had started past the
lower end of the island, and that marking their
own departure. That was not over ten minutes
all told, he believed, though had any of the
others been asked they would have said twice
that because they were excited at the time, and
seconds were drawn out doubly long.</p>

<p>Well, saying that it was ten minutes, and the
boat was going at the rate of twelve miles an
hour that would mean the stolen craft had a lead
of about two miles all told. Jack knew that
they should cut this down before an hour had
crept by, unless something happened to hold
them up, an accident to the Wireless, or to his
own motor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>So when something like half an hour had
gone, he began to exhibit more or less anxiety
as to whether any signs of the white boat could
be seen down-stream. In order to find this out
at the earliest opportunity Jack had stationed
his “crew” up forward in the bow, where he
could have nothing in the way; and as the moon
was about in the east he was not compelled to
stare into its bright shaft of silvery light.</p>

<p>Every once in a while Jack would call out
to ask whether there had anything appeared in
sight. Josh answered him three separate times,
and then laughingly said:</p>

<p>“Say, d’ye know what you make me think of,
Jack? Remember in the old nursery tale of
Bluebeard, where the poor wife, whose head is
going to be cut off by the bad man keeps calling
up to her sister, who is watching the road for
the coming of their brothers: ‘Sister Ann, Sister
Ann, is there anything coming?’ Well, just
now, Jack, I can’t even say I see a cloud of dust
in the distance, as Sister Ann&mdash;hold on there,
Josh, don’t be in such a big hurry. Is that a
moving object, or are you seeing things that
hadn’t ought to be there?”</p>

<p>He bent forward the better to look. Just
then from the other boat the voice of Andy was
heard to call out eagerly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure, ’tis something I say beyant there;
and to me way of thinkin’ it looks as much loike
a white boat as two peas resimble aich ither!”</p>

<p>That started Josh, who did not exactly relish
the idea of having to play what he called
“second fiddle.”</p>

<p>“Right you are, Andy, though a bit late,
because I was just telling Jack here that our
intended prey was in sight. But I’m real glad
to hear you say you can see it too, better two
heads than one, even if&mdash;well, I won’t finish
that sentence, because you might think I was
comparing your coco to a mere vegetable.
There, Jack, look for yourself and see,” he went
on, as the skipper managed to leave his engine
long enough to push forward a little.</p>

<p>So Jack did take a good look, and when he
had done so, he added his opinion to that of the
other two boys.</p>

<p>“Guess there isn’t a shadow of doubt about
that, fellows; because I can see the thing
moving right along; yes, that’s the runaway
motor boat, and we’re going to catch up with
the same inside of twenty minutes, unless something
that isn’t down on the bills comes to pass.”</p>

<small>OVERHAULED</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I like that!” George was heard to
exclaim; and it was noticed that he seemed
to be greatly amused over something or other.</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, George?” asked Josh; for
the two boats were so close together all this
while that those aboard could exchange comments
without great difficulty; although they
had to raise their voices considerably, because
of the furious rattling of the exhausts.</p>

<p>“It must be a joke, be the powers;” broke in
Andy, “because he’s been laughin’ that quiet
loike till himsilf this long toime.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it is, a joke!” declared George;
“and by that, I mean the wonderful Saunterer.
Our new friend, Algernon, didn’t you hear him
call his expensive craft a speed boat? Say, it’s
a wonder, that’s what! The only thing I’m
surprised at is his giving her such a gentle name.
He ought to have called her Chain-Lightning,
Blue Streak, or something like that. Why?
Because she goes like a shot&mdash;nit. A speed
boat, that thing? Well, and her doing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
twelve miles an hour at her best too! I could
cut circles all around her, if only you’d let me
go, Jack. And look at the Tramp walking up
on her; yet when did you call your craft a speed
boat, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s what’s so funny to you, is it?”
Jack went on to say. “But you must remember
who owns the Saunterer, George. Perhaps,
when she’s doing her best she seems to be flying
through the water like mad to Algernon. Everybody
doesn’t happen to be built the same as
you, George.”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not,” declared the other,
immediately.</p>

<p>“And there are a whole lot of people who are
mighty glad of it,” put in Josh.</p>

<p>“Arrah! that’s thrue, ivery word av it,”
echoed Andy. “Sure the world’d be turned
upside-down in a hurry, av there were many
Georges runnin’ around loose, thryin’ to bate
ivery other George. I do be sayin’ ’em wid
their tongues hangin’ out av their mouths and,
always lookin’ for a race. Now, belave me
the ould Comfort is a hape more to me likin’
than a boat that cuts through the wather loike
a knife; and kapes ye thinkin’ ye are sittin’ on
the sharp edge all the while.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, there have to be different kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
people in this old world,” sang out the undaunted
George, “and we happen to be built
on different models, that’s all. You never saw
a race horse, one of the thoroughbred type, but
what he was nervous, and finely strung. I
suppose that’s the way I am constructed.
Can’t help it, to save me. I’m really unhappy
to be going slow at any time.”</p>

<p>And that was really a fact, for George ate his
meals in a hurry, studied his lessons with a rush;
and when he played football was always a terror
upon the lines, carrying things with him; though
apt to prove a weak defense in the end from over-exertion.</p>

<p>While this little heart-to-heart talk was going
on, they kept drawing steadily closer to the
white boat.</p>

<p>Jack had begun to speculate on what was apt
to happen when finally the pursuers were able
to overtake the fugitive craft. He knew that
the desperate men who were aboard would not
be apt to think of surrendering easily, and
especially when they knew or suspected that
their foes consisted for the most part simply of
half-grown boys.</p>

<p>They were armed, too, which was a fact calculated
to make Jack act cautiously. True,
he carried his reliable Marlin along with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and at close range a shotgun is a serious
weapon to consider, especially one of hard-shooting,
modern kind, but Jack did not much fancy
having to use this, except as the very last resort.</p>

<p>One thing surprised him not a little; he
wondered why the escaping bank thieves had
not thought to run their boat ashore, and
escape to dry land. Surely they must have
realized before now that the motor boats were
in pursuit of them, and bound to overtake them
at that, before long.</p>

<p>Perhaps they were still a little in doubt.
Then, again, it might be they scorned to show
the white feather in connection with a pursuit
conducted by mere striplings. But Jack secretly
believed there must be another and more likely
reason for their sticking to the boat. If they
landed, they were going to have a hard time of
it avoiding the many officers who, spurred on by
the reward that had likely been offered for their
apprehension, and the return of the stolen
plunder, would be on the lookout at every
cross road in the country south.</p>

<p>Now, if only they could get a chance to change
the color of their craft they might keep right
on moving down the great river, and snap their
fingers at every inquisitive person; for it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
be a white boat that these watchers would be
looking for.</p>

<p>Yes, these things must weigh heavily with the
two men, and make them want to stick by the
stolen motor boat as long as possible. They
may have laid out their plans, and hated to
alter them; and these had to do with a voyage
on the river, running by night, until they reached
a certain place of refuge; it might be down at
St. Louis, for all Jack knew.</p>

<p>No matter what the reason, there was the
white boat, still keeping to the middle of the
wide river, and apparently doing her best to
outrun the two pursuing craft.</p>

<p>When ten minutes had passed they had cut
down that lead to less than half; and it really
looked as if Jack’s prediction was about to come
true.</p>

<p>“What can that dark thing away ahead be,
I wonder?” Jack heard Josh saying about this
time.</p>

<p>As it was of the utmost importance that he
keep in close touch with everything that went
on, no matter how trivial it seemed, the skipper
immediately raised his head, and asked:</p>

<p>“Where-abouts, Josh?”</p>

<p>“Why, look beyond the white boat, and
you’ll see something low down on the water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Jack. Yes, and there’s a dark spot in the middle
of it, too, just like a cheese box on a raft.
Can that be another island, d’ye reckon; and
are they meanin’ to go ashore there, and hold
us off?”</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess not,” remarked Jack, after
taking a good look, “what you see, Josh, is what
you’d call a raft of logs floating down the river.
We’ve seen such pass up our way many a time.
And generally the two men aboard will have a
little cabin, where they take turns sleeping,
when voyaging at night, which they don’t often
do, I reckon. Yes, I believe I can see signs of
a couple of lighted lanterns. They’re to tell
steamboats to sheer off; and they always do,
because a collision with all those big logs would
go hard with any boat.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right, Jack,” admitted the
other, yielding readily to the argument which
he realized was convincing. “But say, d’ye
think our men see that same old raft? Could
they be making for it, now, meanin’ to board
the same, and keep us off?”</p>

<p>That idea had flashed into Jack’s mind, but
as yet he could not say; for he was unable to
see just what advantage such a course would be
to the fugitives. True, the pursuers had been
overhauling them so fast of late that it began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to appear as though they were having trouble
with the engine Jenks had fixed. If that
proved to be the case, then they might have been
seized with a fear that they were going to be
overhauled; and as it was too late now to reach
land, the next best thing would be to make a
floating battery of the raft, and keep their persistent
enemies off, until they could steer the
clumsy float nearer the shore.</p>

<p>“What’s the programme, Jack?” called
George, who was doubtless fairly quivering
with excitement, and eager for hostilities to
begin.</p>

<p>“You come up on the left, while we take
the right,” replied the other, just as though he
had figured all this out, as he undoubtedly had.</p>

<p>“Do we board the pirate boat?” George
went on.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to, if we expect to retake it for
Algernon,” Jack answered.</p>

<p>“They’ll put up a stiff fight, Jack, don’t forget
that,” the skipper of the Wireless went
on to say.</p>

<p>“Well, if only they’d get cold feet it’d make
it all the easier for us,” Josh broke in with, just
then. “And don’t I wish every fellow had a
gun like Jack, here. Then we’d have ’em dead
to rights, and they’d soon throw up the sponge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
when we started in to bombard the lot with
shot. Say, Jack, you expect to use that same
little Marlin, I hope; for what’s the good of a
gun when you won’t make it squeal?”</p>

<p>“I’ll use it to let them know we’re armed,
first of all,” Jack explained, “and that might
go a good ways toward making them surrender.”</p>

<p>“But hold on, Jack, don’t do that if the two
shells are all you’ve got. A nice sort of thing
that’d be, to scare the game, and not have anything
to pink ’em with afterwards,” Josh went
on to say, in alarm.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve got a few more in my pocket,”
returned the other. “I was wise enough to slip
some shells in my coat before we left camp the
first time. Don’t worry about that, Josh.
There! wasn’t that a man’s head bobbing up
above the stern of the other boat just then?”</p>

<p>It certainly must have been, for immediately
there came a hoarse hail across the intervening
water.</p>

<p>“Hello! there, you in the motor boats!”</p>

<p>“Hello! yourself! what d’ye want?” demanded
George; before Jack could say a word;
for George did everything so quickly it was hard
to get ahead of him.</p>

<p>“We want you to sheer off, and mind your
own business, hear that?” replied the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
aboard the white boat belonging to Algernon.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we are doing,” Jack called
out. “You’ve made a mistake and gone off
with the wrong boat. Yours is up above, on
the island; and that one belongs to a friend of
ours. We want it; and what’s more, we’re
going to take it back. Do you get that?”</p>

<p>The two men could be heard talking hurriedly
together. Possibly they were trying to
figure out just what the boy meant and if it
could be that their real identity were as yet
unsuspected. If the boys simply looked on
them as boat thieves, perhaps they might manage
to deceive them in some way. But when
the man spoke once more it was evident that
they could not wholly reconcile themselves to
this idea.</p>

<p>“We want to warn you to keep off, or you’re
apt to get hurt right bad. We’re heavily
armed, and will shoot straight, take that from
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! say you so?” called out George, mockingly,
“well, perhaps there are two who can
play at that game, mister. Guess we’ve got
firearms along, too; and can pepper your hides
with Number Seven shot till you’ll look like a
Christmas plum pudding. Jack, shall we give
’em a volley right now?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>ABOARD THE FLOATING RAFT</small></h2>


<p>Now, of course George must be only saying
this for effect. He was aware of the fact that
they had only one gun among them; and also
that Jack would hardly be the person to use
that recklessly.</p>

<p>“Listen to George talkin’ through his hat,”
whispered Josh, to the skipper of the Tramp,
as they continued to draw closer and closer to
the white boat.</p>

<p>Again they could hear the two men exchanging
hurried words. It looked as if the situation
was none of their choosing, and that they did
not particularly fancy it.</p>

<p>“If you won’t keep back, then take that!”
suddenly shouted the heavy-voiced man; and
immediately following his words there came a
bright flash, and the report of a pistol.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed some one aboard the Wireless;
and Jack had a shock.</p>

<p>“Anybody hurt over there?” he sang out, as
he snatched up his shotgun, and made ready
to use it; if the answer was to the effect that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
damage had been done, Jack might turn the
weapon directly on the fleeing craft, and scatter
the contents of a shell in that quarter.</p>

<p>“Er, no, guess not,” replied George, “but
say, that bullet hummed right past my head,
and I nearly broke my neck trying to dodge it.
Jack, give ’em a return shot, please do!”</p>

<p>“Bang!” went a second discharge.</p>

<p>This time the man in the fugitive motor boat
had evidently turned his attention toward the
Tramp, for Jack and those with him plainly
heard the peculiar whistle of the passing lead.</p>

<p>It was too much. Jack could stand for a good
deal, but this thing of being made a target to
suit the whim of a rascally thief galled him.
There was one way in which it might be stopped;
and this was to let them understand that when
George said they were armed it was no idle
boast, although they might not be bristling
with weapons, as he would have had the others
believe.</p>

<p>And so Jack let fly with one barrel of his
Marlin, aiming to one side of the white boat,
now close at hand.</p>

<p>The charge of shot ploughed up the water.
It also caused the head to vanish from the stern
of the boat. Evidently that shot created something
like a little panic aboard the Saunterer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
How were those two men to know but what
every fellow pitted against them gripped some
sort of dangerous firearm, and with boyish
abandon was ready to make use of it?</p>

<p>They did not shoot again, and from this circumstance
Jack believed that they were ready
to change their plans. If the pursuers could
not be frightened off by threats, perhaps they
might be content to withdraw, if they could
only recover the stolen boat again.</p>

<p>“They’re going to pass the raft by, Jack!”
ventured Josh, just then.</p>

<p>“Think so?” the other went on to remark,
“well, I’m just guessing otherwise, and that
they mean to run alongside. Look sharp,
Josh, and you’ll see how they keep on edging
that way.”</p>

<p>“What if they leave the motor boat and make
a run for the log cabin on the raft&mdash;will you
crack away at ’em, Jack, and try to hit the fellers
in the legs?” was what the excited Josh
wanted to know.</p>

<p>Jack had to laugh softly at that.</p>

<p>“You talk as if any one could put a load of
shot just where he wanted it, without doing
any serious damage,” he remarked. “If that
was easy, I’d like to tickle those chaps; but
there’s too serious a chance of crippling them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
for life, or even worse than that. We’re so
close now that a load of Sevens would go just
like a great big bullet. I’m not ready for that
and won’t be unless they hurt one of our
crowd. If that happens, they’ll have to look
out.”</p>

<p>“There they go, heading in to the logs, just
like you said, Jack!” cried Josh, more worked
up than ever. “Oh! please give ’em another
shot if they jump on the raft. P’raps it might
scare the pair so much they’d just throw up
their hands, and surrender.”</p>

<p>“Do you see the men who are running the
logs down-stream?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Of course I do, two of ’em, and they look
like they hardly knew what all this racket
means,” Josh continued. “Now, wouldn’t it
be just great if they jumped our birds, and
got ’em. All we’d have to do then would be to
take charge of the scamps, hand over a little
reward to the raftsmen, and start back. Look!
Jack, there, they are going to strike the logs
now. They’ve shut off the motor, you see,
and that tells the story. Take it from me we’ve
got the fellers bad scared right now. Whoop!
George, knock ’em both over with your elephant
gun! Quick! soak it to ’em, fellers!”</p>

<p>Of course Josh was only shouting this last in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
order to further alarm the two fugitives. For
some reason or other the men had determined
to abandon their boat. Perhaps they found it
was commencing to balk, and could not be
depended on. Then again, as the others had
overtaken them, it was plain that they must
open up some other means for escaping.</p>

<p>Jack still clung to his former idea that the
men hoped the boys would be satisfied with
recovering the stolen Saunterer; and finding
that they were ready to defend themselves
would withdraw. Then they could force the
raftsmen to steer the clumsy craft over to
whichever shore they thought safer, and in this
way they might escape with their booty.</p>

<p>The white boat came alongside the raft, and
bumped heavily.</p>

<p>Two flying figures were seen to leave the boat,
and find a footing on the slippery logs. Immediately
they did so they started headlong
toward the center where the little log-cabin
shelter stood; just as though their plans had
all been arranged beforehand.</p>

<p>Whether that shout from Josh calling on
George to blaze away gave them additional
cause for excitement, or the fact of the logs
being wet and slippery made them lose their
footing more than a few times, the fact was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
they took a number of headers, and found the
passage a rocky one.</p>

<p>George was still shouting at the top of his
voice, and the others joined in, so that the
clamor was quite deafening. No wonder the
loggers stood there unable to understand what
it was all about, and why those two had abandoned
the fine white boat that was now drifting
alongside the raft.</p>

<p>“Too bad, Jack!” Josh was saying, when
the two fugitives, after making their way along
the logs finally vanished inside the door of the
rude little cabin shelter.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the skipper, who had
also shut off power, and was bent on bringing
the Tramp alongside the raft just below the
Saunterer; so that the white boat could be
caught and secured, which would be one part
of their plans brought to a successful completion.</p>

<p>“He’s got the boodle, Jack, plague take the
luck!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw that the small man was carrying
a bag with him, and of course that holds the
stolen bank papers and cash,” Jack went on to
say, as the Tramp’s nose came with a gentle
bump against the outside log.</p>

<p>“Tell me what to do, Jack!” Josh demanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
knowing that the other must have a plan of some
sort in view in making this landing, if their
hugging the raft could come under that name.</p>

<p>“Just jump off and take the hawser with
you,” said the skipper, quickly.</p>

<p>“Then you mean to tie up here?” asked
Josh, as he started to obey directions.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Say, Jack, shall I get a grip on the painter
of that other boat while I’m on the raft and
make her fast?” continued Josh.</p>

<p>“Try and see if you can, because we want to
take her back with us, even if we fail to capture
the men,” Jack replied.</p>

<p>No doubt George was bringing his Wireless
alongside the raft on the other side, for he could
see across, and note what the crew of the Tramp
seemed to be doing.</p>

<p>Josh was quite active, when spurred on by
excitement. When he had made a three-base
hit in a game of baseball, he could stretch it to
a home run better than any other fellow in
town, with the shouts of the crowds to inspire
him.</p>

<p>He began to hunt around for some place to
fasten the rope, as soon as he had jumped on
to the raft. This was so difficult a task, because
there were many pegs showing, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the logs were held together. And besides, here
and there was a heavy rope passed along, to
keep the waves made by steamboats from scattering
the logs, which might have been of
especial value.</p>

<p>Josh had just managed to accomplish this,
and was turning to try and get hold of the bow
of the white boat, which was still bumping
against the side of the raft, when a terrific
splash was heard from across on the opposite
edge of the logs.</p>

<p>“George is overboard!” whooped Josh, thinking
that the impulsive one must have been in
such a big hurry to gain a footing, afraid lest a
chum would be ahead of him, that he had miscalculated.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, it’s Andy; and he’s all to
the good; climbing on the logs right now,”
came in the well-known tones of the Wireless
skipper, and with a touch of sarcasm connected
with the words, as though George wanted them
to know that he was not the only fellow who
could, in his haste, make blunders.</p>

<p>“Sure I am!” echoed Andy, “and the wather
’tis foine, I’m tilling ye, me laddybucks. Now,
George, me darlint, whereabouts shall I tie
up at?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Anywhere, so long as we hold fast,” came
the order.</p>

<p>Well, here was a strange condition of affairs,
to be sure, Jack thought. He was a little puzzled
to know what they ought to do next. The
two desperate men had retreated within the
shanty on the raft, which they undoubtedly
meant to hold, after the manner of a fort, having
abandoned Algernon’s motor boat. The pursuers
already had this in their possession, so
if nothing more were accomplished, they could
feel fairly well satisfied with their night’s work.</p>

<p>But Jack felt that George, and for that matter
the other two chums, would not wish to drop
out of the game then and there. Knowing that
the men in the shanty were the robbers, whose
apprehension would bring great joy to the bereaved
depositors in that robbed Lawrence bank,
it would be just like them to want to keep going
until they had either accomplished that end,
or else found that they were not equal to the
task.</p>

<p>Yes, and deep down in his own heart Jack
was thinking along pretty much the same lines.
He knew what it was to be greeted with cheers;
and the desire to accomplish things worth while
had a lodgment in Jack’s heart.</p>

<p>They had the two rascals bottled up, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
were; and surely some way could be found
whereby they might force their surrender.</p>

<p>But it was not going to be an easy task.
Those men knew what they must accept once
they were taken into custody; and doubtless
they would fight to the last gasp before showing
the white flag.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>HOLDING THE FORT</small></h2>


<p>All was silent over yonder where the makeshift
little cabin shelter stood about the middle
of the raft. The men had vanished inside, and
were no doubt waiting to see what their enemies
attempted next. Perhaps they indulged in the
hope that the troublesome boys, assisted by
Jenks, would draw off, and leave them to play
their game to a finish in their own way.</p>

<p>At the same time they must be ready to
defend their new place of refuge bitterly. Jack
knew the folly of trying to carry a fort by assault,
and he was not silly enough to think
that with only George, Josh, Andy and Jenks
back of him such a desperate undertaking could
be carried out. Even if they received reinforcements
in the shape of the two husky
loggers, that would not mean the thing would
be a walk-over.</p>

<p>Jack was himself on the logs by this time,
and Jenks followed him. He hoped the men
at bay would not start shooting toward them,
for they were more or less exposed to any fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
unless they managed to drop down behind a
stray log that had at some time gotten loose,
and was hauled on top of the raft by the men in
charge, rather than have it lost.</p>

<p>“Keep by your boat, George!” was the first
thing Jack called out, “or better still, if you
can work it around to where the Tramp lies.
Perhaps we’d be wise to keep in a bunch, you
know.”</p>

<p>“A good idea, Jack,” came the reply. “Andy,
do you dare walk across, while I get a move on,
and swim around?”</p>

<p>“Me, is it ye arre afther askin’ that? Well,
till me what’s to hinder me from doin’ the
same?” and with the words the dripping Andy
started to clamber along the slippery logs with
utter abandon; he had been in the river once,
and was just as wet as he could be, so why
should he care if he went overboard again?</p>

<p>George started up and was seen to leave the
float.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and good riddance to you!” the
big man shouted, as he thrust his head out of
the opening in front of the cabin on the raft;
from which remark it might be set down that
he had not heard what Jack said, and really
believed the motor boat was about to pull out
for good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” replied the other, for it was not
difficult to please Josh under most circumstances.</p>

<p>George had gone around the raft, passing
below, so that he was now coming up the river,
and it was easy for him to bring his boat alongside
the raft without any bumping worth mentioning.</p>

<p>He quickly leaped on to the logs, rope in
hand, and found a place to fasten his hawser
without much trouble.</p>

<p>“Where are they, fellows?” he asked, breathlessly,
as he joined the group.</p>

<p>“Still in the shack, but we’re going to try
and get them out,” Jack answered.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Josh broke in just then;
“you see, Jack’s going to try a scheme of mine,
and offer the men a chance to get off, on condition
that they hand over that bag they got.
We don’t want to bother with persons, if only
we c’n trap that little bag, and take it back
with us.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” said George, immediately, for he
never had the least bit of faith in any idea which
Josh might originate; it would have put a
different face on it if Jack had advanced the
scheme; but with the other as its sponsor, the
thing was impossible in the start and condemned
before he heard the particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you never know,” Josh went on to
say, as if he felt hurt at George being so positive
before the proposition had even been tried,
“they might be that bad scared they’d agree
to anything that left ’em their liberty. Anyhow,
guess there ain’t any harm in doin’ it,
is there?”</p>

<p>“Wait and see!”</p>

<p>And with that Jack turned toward the center
of the raft, where the little refuge lay, which
the two loggers made use of as sleeping quarters,
and to keep themselves dry during a downpour
of rain.</p>

<p>“Hello! you in the cabin?” he called out.</p>

<p>“Well, what d’ye want?” came the answer,
and as before, it was evidently the big man who
did all the talking, for as yet they had not once
heard the voice of Slim Jim raised above a low
murmur, when he was arguing with his companion.</p>

<p>“We’ve got an offer to make you,” continued
Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh! have yuh? Then spit her out, and be
quick about it,” came from inside.</p>

<p>“We’ll agree to let you both go, if you hand
over that bag, and all that’s in it,” Jack continued.
“We’ve got you caged, anyway, and
it’s only a question of going for the officers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
one of our boats, when we come to a large town;
and you’ll be taken, bag and all. Better think
it over. And we don’t mean to let you work
the sweep of this raft, so you can’t ferry it to
the shore. What do you say?”</p>

<p>He was answered with a mocking laugh, and
some hard words.</p>

<p>“What d’ye take us for, younker, a pair of
fools? Think we went to all that trouble and
risk to turn the proceeds over to a passel o’ kids
so easy? Don’t you worry ’bout us, now. We
got the guns to hold the fort; and when we get
good and ready p’raps we’ll skip out. There’s
more ways to skin a cat than one. Get that,
now?”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said George, with one of his
irritating little laughs. “Now just get busy,
Josh, and think up some more fool plays, won’t
you? Or else leave the job to your betters,
Jack’n me, we’ll play the game for keeps, eh,
Jack?”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>MAKING THINGS WARM</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what are we going to do next, Jack?”
asked Josh, pretending not to hear those irritating
words spoken by George; and evidently
determined to keep himself “in the swim” if
anything was going on.</p>

<p>“The question is whether we’d better try
to force their hand now, or wait a while,” the
one spoken to remarked.</p>

<p>“Why should we wait?” queried George,
impatiently.</p>

<p>“First of all, there’s some sort of chance that
Herb may be along pretty soon, with his Comfort,
and that would give us three more fellows,”
Jack observed.</p>

<p>“Huh! such as they are, yes,” the skipper
of the speed-boat admitted.</p>

<p>“Three would make good showing, anyhow,”
Josh broke in to say, seeing his opportunity to
agree with Jack, and in this way put George
on the other side. “And how’d they know,
tell me, that Buster, Herb and our new friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Algernon, ain’t much on the scrap? Numbers
look big, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Then again,” Jack continued, “as we float
down the river we’re apt to sight the lights of
some town or city. And then George could go
ashore to tell the police what a great chance was
passing their doors. I’m not greedy about it,
and willing enough to let the proper authorities
do the fighting, and get what there is in the
game. And yet, it kind of goes against my grain
to just lie around here, doing nothing all the
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said George, eagerly, “and just think
if we happen to drift anywhere near the bank
these fellows are apt to give us the laugh and
jump overboard, to swim ashore. Before we
could get a boat started to chase after ’em they’d
land, and snap their fingers at the lot. I say
get a move on, and find some way to make ’em
surrender. Let’s scare the pair half to death.
We c’n do it by setting the cabin on fire, and
paying for the damage done!”</p>

<p>“Whew! that’s just like George!” Josh was
heard to say, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Jack glanced toward the two loggers.</p>

<p>“Is that sort of a thing possible; could the
shanty be burned if we tried?” he asked them.</p>

<p>“Don’t think it kin, son,” came the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
“Course we never seen it tried; but them logs
are kinder green yet, and the spray’s jumped
up over the cabin sometimes when we had a
headwind. They ain’t no winder in the shack,
jest a openin’ like round on the back. I cud
crawl up and try the fire game, if so yuh stand
ready tuh pony up fur any damage tuh the
logs.”</p>

<p>Jack was thinking again.</p>

<p>“Well, it might pay us to make the try,”
he said, presently.</p>

<p>“No harm done,” said George, giving Josh
a triumphant look, as though he would have
him take notice that when really smart fellows
started to do things, they meant business every
time.</p>

<p>Josh shrugged his shoulders, as much as to
say that he was ready to be convinced. Meanwhile
Jack was talking with the two loggers,
trying to find out what their ideas might be
with regard to getting a supply of kindling
ready. One of them strode off, and presently
returned with an ax. The other had picked up
several strips of wood that seemed to be fairly
dry; and as soon as the sharp-edged tool came
he started to cut this into long splinters.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said George, “I’ve got some
cotton waste aboard my boat that’s just soaked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
with oil, and would burn like fun. I’ll get it.”</p>

<p>“And if you go aboard my boat, too, you’ll
find a lot more close by the engine, that I was
going to throw overboard, because it was getting
so sticky,” Jack went on to tell the other, as he
was hurrying off.</p>

<p>It really began to look like business, at any
rate. Josh found himself interested in spite of
himself. No matter whose plan it might be, if
it won out he must show a spirit of fairness,
and render all the aid he could. Josh was not
a small minded fellow, though he did love to
tease poor Buster on occasion; and often went
out of his way to get a sly dig at the good-natured
fat boy.</p>

<p>The strips of wood having been reduced to
kindling, and George coming back with the
cotton waste, saturated with oil that would burn,
even if it was not explosive, it began to look as
though the thing was now up to the logger who
had offered to make the attempt.</p>

<p>“Here’s a little bottle, and it’s full of gasoline
too,” remarked George, as he handed the
article over. “When you’re ready to set fire
to the pile, just scatter that stuff over it, and
take care of your eyebrows, for she goes off
with a whoop.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, they’re on to us,” announced Josh
just then.</p>

<p>Looking toward the cabin, Jack could detect
a head thrust around the corner; and from this
he knew that one of the men had issued forth,
wishing to learn what the forces arrayed against
himself and his partner might be doing all this
while.</p>

<p>So Jack made suggestive motions with his
gun, as though tempted to shoot; and the head
was withdrawn immediately.</p>

<p>“Is there any opening on the back of the
shack?” he asked the men.</p>

<p>“Nope, not that yuh cud notice, son,” came
the reply.</p>

<p>“Course, they might dodge out and run around
to blaze away at our fire kindler, and then get
back under cover again,” suggested George.</p>

<p>“I was thinking if I could work it so as to
keep them quiet,” said Jack. “Let’s all move
around so as to cover the side where the open
door is. Then they’ll be liable to think we’re
all there in a bunch. And if we see either man
trying to sneak out, I’ll give him a scare, all
right.”</p>

<p>To do this they had to go some little distance
from the three tied-up motor boats; but Jack
knew they could reach them long before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
fugitives might, should they conceive the wild
idea of making a dash that way. Besides,
as a last resort, did he not have his gun, and
were there not two trusty shells in its barrels?</p>

<p>Having taken up their position they gave the
man who had remained behind the signal that
he should get busy. And he started to advance
toward the rear of the cabin on the raft.</p>

<p>When he had gone perhaps half way, a figure
was seen to push out of the opening. Jack
immediately called out:</p>

<p>“Get back there, or I’ll fill you full of shot!”
at the same time brandishing his gun in a very
threatening manner; which warning appeared
to have an influence upon the fellow, since he
slipped back again.</p>

<p>But no doubt he had discovered the logger
who was advancing toward the rear of the
shack, his arms filled with fuel; and it would
have to be a very dull person who could not
guess what his object must be.</p>

<p>Then there sounded a sudden report. One
of the men in the shack had found some small
chink between the logs, through which he was
firing his revolver. Perhaps he had shot at the
logger; and then again it might have been done
just to alarm him, and thus cause the scheme
for firing the cabin to be given up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>When the man seemed to drop, Jack’s heart
was in his throat, for he thought he was looking
on a tragedy; but the other logger chuckled,
as he remarked:</p>

<p>“Don’t be skeered ’bout Fritz; he ain’t
teched a whiff; but jest drapped so’s to crawl
out’n range. See him gittin’ over ground right
smart now, and notice thet he ain’t let go any
o’ the stuff, be he?”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Hanky,” said Josh, promptly
enough.</p>

<p>“Bully for Fritz!” burst out the gratified
George, whose heart had no doubt taken just
as quick a jump as had Jack’s, when that report
sounded in a half muffled way, from being inside
the cabin.</p>

<p>Another shot followed. But the marksman
was evidently shooting at random, and without
having a target. At any rate, the logger kept
right on creeping toward the shack, and it
began to look as though he were bound to get
there, too.</p>

<p>But would he be successful in getting the
logs to burn?</p>

<p>Jack was rather inclined to doubt it, though
of course much depended on whether they were
fairly dry, or wet with the spray that may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
dashed up over the raft when the wind, being
up-river, had made a choppy sea.</p>

<p>“What if the whole blooming raft goes up
in smoke?” was the awful suggestion which
Josh put forward.</p>

<p>George laughed out loud, it seemed to strike
him as so absurd.</p>

<p>“Yes, and worse still, Josh, whatever will
we do if we set the river on fire? They’ll certainly
have it in for us, believe me. But one
thing sure, no danger of you ever setting the
river afire with any scheme you think up.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! I don’t believe it’ll work a cent,”
remarked Josh. “’Cording to my calculations
it’d take more’n that kindlin’ to set logs
a-goin’.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the oiled rags, Josh,” said
George, tauntingly; “yes, and the little bottle
of gasolene I let our friend have. Seems to me
all that’s going to build up some fire. And as
for the rest we’ll have to trust to luck. Perhaps
it’ll catch fire, and again she may kick and
balk.”</p>

<p>“Like some engines we know about, f’r
instance,” Josh wound up with.</p>

<p>“You never saw a motor do better than mine
did coming down river, and you know it. I
have had a lot of trouble with the thing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
past; but that’s all over now; and I’m on
Easy Street with my dandy Wireless. Oh!
you can laugh all you want to, Josh, but wait
and see.”</p>

<p>“Proof of the puddin’ lies in the eatin’ of the
same, George,” said Josh, “and I know you too
well to believe you’ll ever be satisfied to run
along like Jack and Herb do. But see there,
our fire kindler’s got up to the shack, all serene.
And now he’s bending down to fix his kindlin’
right. We’ll soon know, George, and if she
goes, since it’s your scheme, I’m willing to say
you done it with your little hatch-it.”</p>

<p>Just as Josh said, the logger had managed to
gain the shelter of the back wall of the shack.
Now, in order to keep out the rain without
bothering with a door, the cabin had been made
with its only opening on the side up-river; so
that what the boys had been calling its back
was really the front side.</p>

<p>And with the movement of the raft always
down-stream; and the night air being from the
south just then, if the fire were ever properly
started, it would be fanned constantly, and
helped along by this process.</p>

<p>Jack kept watch on the dark opening that
stood for the entrance, and means of exit. He
meant to shoot, if any figure was seen to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
outside this; not with the idea of doing bodily
injury, but in the expectation of frightening the
man back, before he could make use of his weapon
upon the fire-kindler.</p>

<p>So the seconds crept along, until several
minutes had passed.</p>

<p>“Gee! why don’t he get a move on?” remarked
George, to whom the time hung as if it
were weighed down with lead.</p>

<p>“Let him be,” said the other logger, named
Hanky. “Fritz is sum slow, but then he gits
there in the end. Watch his smoke, son, an’
see!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>“DROP THAT BAG”</small></h2>


<p>They kept waiting, but George was very
nervous because nothing seemed to happen. He
growled to himself more than a few times; but
none of the other boys paid any attention to
that; because they knew George pretty well,
and had run up against his little failings many
a time.</p>

<p>George had no use for “slow-pokes.” He
expected to see Rome built in a day, and
strange to say, while he met with lots of trouble
on account of this very desire for haste, it did
not seem to effect any permanent cure in his
disposition; for as soon as the unpleasant result
had worn off, he was the same old George again,&mdash;Hurricane
George, they used to call him at
home.</p>

<p>“There, looks like he’s about got it fixed
now,” announced Josh, presently.</p>

<p>“Oh! thank goodness!” said the skipper of
the Wireless with a sigh of gratification that
welled up from his very heart. “Now perhaps
there’ll be something doing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s getting out a match,” Josh went on.</p>

<p>“You mean he’s hunting all through his
pockets for one,” corrected Jack.</p>

<p>That gave George another spell of the blues.</p>

<p>“Chances are he won’t have a blessed match
about him,” he observed, despairingly. “And
I’ve got half a notion right now to crawl out
there, and do the business for Fritz.”</p>

<p>“No need,” remarked Josh, “he’s found one!”</p>

<p>Then they watched again, while the logger
went through with a lot of what seemed to
George utterly useless actions, fixing the kindling
up a little better. And finally he started
to strike the match.</p>

<p>The boys held their breath as they saw it
flame up.</p>

<p>“Now, look out, Fritz, or you’ll lose your
eyebrows!” George was heard to mutter; as
the logger leaned over to apply the little flame,
which he had been shielding with both hands,
after the manner of an old smoker.</p>

<p>“Wow!”</p>

<p>Josh did not mean to call out, but the cry
was almost forced from his lips as he saw a vivid
flash of fire, that seemed to jump as high as the
roof of the little log shack.</p>

<p>“That was the gasolene!” remarked George,
coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fritz got stung, I guess, because he tumbled
over backwards,” Josh ventured, as his opinion;
but although Jack had imagined that something
along those lines might have happened, he did
not see the man show any signs of suffering, as
he started to crawl away from the spot, glancing
over his shoulder now and then, as if to reassure
himself that everything was going well.</p>

<p>“Naw, he’s all right; Fritz kin be quick
when he wants to get out o’ the way o’ things
that hurts,” the fellow logger advanced.</p>

<p>“Wonder if she’s going to take hold?” Josh
ventured, as he watched the fire eat into the
kindling merrily.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t be s’prised if she did, now?”
Hank remarked, as though he had experienced
a change of heart since the match had been
applied. “Looky thar at the way it’s eatin’
up the logs. Gosh! that makes a hot fire, boys,
with them oil rags to keep her a-goin’. And
sure as yuh live I c’n see it getting a grip o’ the
logs right now. Guess we won’t hev airy
shanty, come morning. But who keers. A
little saw-buck o’ a ten dollar bill wud make
that squar.”</p>

<p>Jack looked around.</p>

<p>If the cabin really caught fire, and began
to burn furiously, it would not be long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
those within would have to vacate. He wanted
to get a good idea as to what their next move
would be; and for that reason he took this
observation, so as to be posted.</p>

<p>And the first thing he saw was that the current
of the river had swung the log raft in to
the western shore during the last ten minutes
or so. Why, it was not more than a hundred
yards away; and as the moon hung in the east,
the whole shore line was brightly illuminated.</p>

<p>Would not that prove an irresistible attraction
to the pair of hunted thieves, provided they
could swim? As a last resort might they not
think to make a run for the edge of the raft,
and spring overboard?</p>

<p>That was all right, provided they left the
little bag behind. If on the other hand they
tried to carry it off, Jack must know what to
do about it. He feared that sooner than give
up their plunder the scoundrels would deliberately
throw it into the river, and thus defraud
the depositors and stockholders of the Lawrence
bank out of their valuable property, as well as
sink the evidence that might be used to incriminate
them as the looters of the institution.</p>

<p>How to prevent this was the question that
was bothering Jack.</p>

<p>Would he be justified in trying to cripple one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of the robbers in case they attempted to carry
out such a bold scheme?</p>

<p>He decided this quickly, when he remembered
what misery would likely follow the loss of the
bag, with its contents. Yes, what was one
wretch’s suffering when compared with that
which would follow the closing of the bank’s
doors, and a sign on the outside telling that it
would never be able to open again, because of
the loss of the entire funds, and negotiable
papers, as the paper had said.</p>

<p>Well, there did not seem to be any more doubt
about the success of the fire, at any rate; for
already were the flames beginning to creep up
the wall of the cabin, licking greedily at the
wood. They had gained such a good start that
unless some fire-fighter got busy in a hurry,
that shack was doomed, for the breeze fanned
the flames wonderfully.</p>

<p>“They’re coming out!” snapped George.</p>

<p>“Get ready, Jack, to drop ’em!” shouted
Josh.</p>

<p>“There’s the old Comfort drawing alongside
the raft by our boats!” Jack sent back at them
just then.</p>

<p>Perhaps those in the cabin had already discovered
the other boat coming down with the
current, for the opening was toward the up-river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
end of the float, it may be remembered.</p>

<p>If so, it must have surely added to their uneasiness.
They could see a number of persons
aboard, and in the deceptive moonlight how
were they to know that these passengers on the
big launch were hardly to be classed with
fighters, at least not very ferocious ones?</p>

<p>Imagine the astonishment of Herb and Buster,
not to speak of Algernon, when, on nearing the
dark object they had discovered ahead, it was
to suddenly discover a blaze shooting up; and
then on looking further to see Jack, George,
Josh, Andy and the man Jenks, as well as two
strange raftsmen ranged, about on a raft of logs,
watching the burning cabin, as though it contained
something they were greatly interested
in.</p>

<p>And then to find the stolen white launch tied
up to the raft&mdash;that must have given them a
clue so they could figure things out fairly well.</p>

<p>The men had thrust their heads out at the
time George and Josh seemed so positive they
were coming. They could not have fancied the
situation much; but then the sight of land so
near by may have put some heart into them.</p>

<p>As the fire got hotter their condition must be
growing more and more unpleasant. Jack knew
that it was only a question of minutes, or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
properly, seconds, before they would be forced
to expose themselves, and he was nerving himself
for that crisis.</p>

<p>He saw Jenks and one of the loggers start to
move to the other side of the raft, as though
they would anticipate the possible coming of
the men in that direction and be on hand to
meet them.</p>

<p>“Keep clear, so that I can fire!” he called to
them, making his voice as vociferous as possible,
in order that the hiding men might catch every
word, and be more or less affected by the startling
intelligence.</p>

<p>“Oh! why didn’t I bring my gun along?”
groaned George, who was suffering agonies
because he just had to stand there, and watch
some one else run things; whereas, did he happen
to have a weapon in his hands, he might
have taken a much more prominent part in the
proceedings.</p>

<p>One good thing about George was that he
always wanted to be on the firing line; for he
did not have a drop of craven blood in his veins.
In baseball, football, hockey, it was all the same;
George could be found wherever the play was
fiercest, taking and giving knocks without a
murmur, if only there was action, action, and
then more action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack heard his lament, and was secretly just
as well satisfied to have things as they were.
George was so impulsive that he might do things
to be regretted in calmer moments. Such a
hot-headed fellow was dangerous with firearms,
especially when there seemed some little excuse
for making a use of the same against a law-breaking
pair like the bank robbers.</p>

<p>For a couple of minutes nothing happened;
but the fire was burning fiercely and crackling
at a great rate. Josh looked rather serious as
he contemplated the conflagration; perhaps he
was remembering George’s absurd threat with
regard to setting the river on fire; and thinking
that they would surely have to get away before
such a catastrophe came to pass.</p>

<p>Then, just what Jack had been expecting
came about.</p>

<p>“There! there! Jack, look! knock ’em over!”
shrieked George, as two figures started out of the
burning shack on the raft, and began to hasten
across the slippery logs as fast as they could go.</p>

<p>One of them, the larger, carried the hand
bag; and from his determined manner it looked
as though he meant to cling to that through
thick and thin. Jenks and the two loggers were
already trying to cut the fugitives off, and as
though they began to fear lest that should really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
happen the robbers changed their course a little,
though still heading for the side of the raft that
lay nearest the western bank of the river, so close
at hand.</p>

<p>Jack fired one barrel of his gun, but he did not
try to hit the fleeing men. It was just intended
to let them know he had their range, for chips
and water flew close beside the one who carried
the bag.</p>

<p>“Drop that bag, or the next shot will lame
you for life, do you hear?” shouted the boy,
now fully resolved that he would have to shoot
to wound, in justice to all those poor depositors
up in Lawrence, for whom he felt so sorry.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was on account of the threat contained
in his words; although the nearness of
Jenks, and the other two husky men, may have
had more or less to do with it; but the escaping
burglar realized that it was a case of either letting
his plunder go, or else being badly wounded,
and then sent to the penitentiary for a term of
years. And so, he relaxed his firm clutch, allowing
the bag with the stolen funds of the bank
to fall upon the logs of the raft.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>EVERYTHING LOVELY&mdash;CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p>That shout of triumph seemed to break forth
from several pair of lips at once, when the taller
one of the two thieves dropped the bag he had
been carrying, as Jack so plainly threatened
to fire upon him at close range.</p>

<p>He was not so much of a fool after all, it
seemed. If there was going to be a chance for
escaping minus the plunder, why, it would have
to go, that was all.</p>

<p>Somehow Jack was reminded of incidents
in his own boyish career. He could see himself
madly tearing across a field, with a whole bevy
of angry bumble-bees chasing after him, and
surging about his unprotected ears; and when
they started to get busy with their hot little
probes, what did he do but dash his hat off, and
then his coat in quick succession. This was to
attract the attention of the bees to other things,
and let him escape. And the manoeuvre was
usually successful, too.</p>

<p>Well, this smart rascal, finding himself threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
with trouble, had just done the same sort
of trick practiced by the bumble-bee fighters
from away back in our great-grandfathers’ days,
throw something down to attract the attention
of the hunters and hold their attention while
he escaped.</p>

<p>It succeeded in the work it was intended to
do.</p>

<p>Jack did not shoot again, and the others all
seemed to think that, since the bag had been
recovered, there was no especial need of almost
killing themselves closing with the desperate
burglars.</p>

<p>They knew that the men were armed, anyway,
and would doubtless use their guns recklessly
if cornered. Better to let them go, and
call it a good riddance of bad rubbish; that was
a boy’s idea of the fitness of things. What was
the use of being greedy; they did not aspire to
be known as thief-takers; and besides, they
owed it to those at home to have some respect
for their own safety.</p>

<p>And so the two alarmed rascals, rushing to the
side of the raft, sprang hurriedly straight into
the river, striking out for the shore with all the
haste they were capable of. Indeed, to see the
way they fought the water, one would imagine
that they fully anticipated having the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
bevy of motor boats in swift pursuit, and that
every second they could gain in the start was
going to count in their favor.</p>

<p>But who cared?</p>

<p>Certainly not Jack, who, pouncing upon the
precious hand bag, opened it just far enough
to see that it was crammed with money and
papers, just as they had been hastily pushed
into it at the time of the raid on the Lawrence
bank.</p>

<p>Some of the others came crowding around,
anxious for a look; but Jack, with a wisdom
that did him credit, remembering that there
were a couple of big rough lumbermen present,
whom he knew nothing about, not to mention
Jenks, was smart enough to close the bag
quickly.</p>

<p>“Is it all right, Jack; everything there?”
asked George, eagerly; and then, as he caught
the low word of warning which the other muttered
he understood; for as quick as that he
went on to say: “All our stuff recovered in
fine style, eh, fellows? Let the scamps go;
we ought to be only too glad to wash our hands
of them.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for us!” shrilled Josh, brimming
over with excitement.</p>

<p>All at once Buster, who had gained a footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
on the logs when Herb brought his big Comfort
to an anchorage there, alongside the raft, was
seen to be wildly rushing toward the edge, and
waving his arms. Then he started to shouting
after the pair of precious scoundrels who were
battling with the waves of the river, and by
this time almost half way to the nearer bank.</p>

<p>“Hey, bring back that sweater, you! That’s
my blue moon sweater you’re wearing, and I
want it, I tell you! I’ll have the law on you
for stealing, d’ye hear that, you sneak? Jack,
why don’t we start right out, and chase ’em
with the Tramp or the Wireless? Seems like
none of you fellers care a whit whether I ever
get my bully old sweater back again. How’d
you feel if it was yours, now, and a birthday
present at that?”</p>

<p>But Buster’s wild grief was suddenly turned
into great joy; for Andy came running out of
the shack, into which he had darted despite
the fact of its being on fire, and he was waving
something over his head as he advanced.</p>

<p>“Troth, phat do ye call this same, Buster?
’Tis a sweater, and sure there’s a blue moon
on the front, in the bargain. Don’t ye say,
the omadhaun sthripped it off so that he could
swim better.”</p>

<p>Buster clasped it to his heart, and actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
kissed the precious garment, which doubtless
he had come to value more than ever, since he
lost it, for we “never miss the water till the
well runs dry.”</p>

<p>And so, after all, the wonderful sweater came
back to its own. Buster had it on right away,
and seemed to feel that luck had marked him
for its especial favors.</p>

<p>“Here, let’s get busy!” cried George, “perhaps
we can save the best part of this cabin after
all. I see an old tin bucket that’ll do to scoop
up water with. Everybody work to put out
the fire, fellows!”</p>

<p>That was just like George, who could be the
most generous chap any one ever met. Those
two loggers had been of considerable assistance
to the boys in baffling the burglars and forcing
them to give up their ill-gotten gains; so that
it would be only right in their trying to remedy
things as much as possible.</p>

<p>Well, the fire was soon gotten under control.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack had gone aboard the Tramp,
where, unobserved, he could again open the
hand bag, and extract some of the money; for
he did not happen to have twenty dollars about
him at the time, since they had not expected
finding any use for so much cash on their simple
little Easter cruise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>This he handed over to the two loggers, calling
upon the others to witness the transaction,
for he might want to prove it later on.</p>

<p>After that the boys began to think of returning
up the river, and reaching their camp on
Bedloe’s Island. Algernon concluded that, since
his boat was in fair running order, and he had
the chance to elude the other “chappie,” with
whom he was playing a game of hide-and-seek
while on the way to St. Louis, he had better
take advantage of the opportunity, and keep
right on down-stream.</p>

<p>Jack and his chums promised to care for what
Algernon had left behind; and on the way up
later he would drop in at the island to recover
the same. If the motor boat boys were not in
camp, having departed for home, he promised
to see them there.</p>

<p>And so Jenks having gone aboard and started
the engine, the Saunterer glided off down the
Mississippi, Algernon shaking hands with each
of the others in turn, and declaring that it had
all been the greatest bit of excitement he had
ever experienced; a remark, which caused
Jack’s crowd to grin, for, as we happen to know,
the boys had been through some remarkable
events in their time.</p>

<p>The three boats were soon on their way up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
river; and reached the island before dawn. It
was a pretty tired lot that crept into the tent,
and slept for several hours. And later in the
day Jack told them that in consideration of the
forlorn condition which he knew the good people
of Lawrence must be in, he would have to take
a run over to a town which lay about eight miles
above. Here he could send the precious bag
and its contents, securely wrapped and sealed,
by express; and at the same time dispatch a
long message at night rates that would tell the
directors of the stricken bank how all their
valuable papers as well as the money that had
been taken were on the way to them, particularly
later when the motor boat boys got back from
their little cruise down the Mississippi.</p>

<p>To this message Jack signed the names of the
whole six chums, his own last of all. Then he
and Josh managed to get back to the island
before evening set in; and a great load had been
taken from Jack’s mind, when he no longer had
to worry about that bag containing nearly all
of the visible assets of the plundered Lawrence
bank.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>“What’s all this fuss going on out here?”
demanded Josh Purdue, as he came crawling
from under the folds of the tent.</p>

<p>It must have been well on to high noon at the
time. The tired boys had been sleeping pretty
much the whole morning away.</p>

<p>No wonder the thin member of the squad was
surprised, for there was Buster Longfellow hurrying
around as though the house had been
afire. Nick could never accomplish anything
worth while without a tremendous amount of
spluttering; as all his mates knew only too well.</p>

<p>Wonderful to relate there was a pretty healthy
odor of cooking in the air, that made Josh sniff
approvingly; for of late his once poor appetite
had grown to respectable proportions; and the
thin boy could demolish his share of “grub”
with the best of them.</p>

<p>Buster glanced around, and grinned.</p>

<p>“Oh! say, but I’m glad somebody else has had
the good sense to wake up, and come out,” he
began to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks like you might be doing the breakfast
stunt all by your lonely,” remarked Josh,
coolly, as he started toward the edge of the
water, no doubt intending to dash some of the
same in his face, and thus refresh himself.</p>

<p>“I seemed to have had all the sleep I wanted,”
continued Buster; “and after I waked up I lay
there for a long time, wondering if anybody had
started in to get breakfast; but I couldn’t get
the first whiff of coffee.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, and an old habit of yours, I
guess, Buster; always laying around waiting for
the birds to come and put something in your
mouth,” Josh flung over his shoulder, with all
the scorn he could summon.</p>

<p>“Well, p’raps it is one of my faults,” admitted
the fat boy, humbly enough; “we’ve all got our
weaknesses, you know, Jack says, and you ain’t
any exception, Josh. But I felt as empty as
an old tomato can, and just couldn’t stand it any
longer; so I crawled out, and I’m doin’ the best
I know how to get breakfast. But of course it
ain’t goin’ to equal what you’d be givin’ us, if
you had hold here. Cookin’ is one of your best
stunts, Josh; fact is, I never knew any feller
that could come near you.”</p>

<p>When Buster wanted he could “soft soap”
equal to the best of them; and while Josh understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
full well that this was a plain invitation
for him to shoulder some of the responsibility
for that coming meal, he found it impossible to
resist the bland smile of the stout chum.</p>

<p>“Rats! you just spread that honey on thick
so as to drag me in; but I’m on to your curves,
Buster. All the same, hold the fort while I
throw some of the Mississippi into my face, and
I’ll relieve you,” he called out as he walked away.</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Josh, and I don’t care who
hears me say so,” cried Buster, who never could
do the cooking act without getting so much
pungent smoke in his poor eyes that he appeared
to be weeping.</p>

<p>Possibly Josh found himself on edge for some
refreshment, and that might account for his
unusual kindness; for he speedily did show up,
and took entire charge of the business.</p>

<p>About this time others began to crawl out of
their blankets; and even George poked his head
over the side of the Wireless; for, as was his
usual custom, he could not feel perfectly happy
away from his beloved if troublesome boat,
even for a single night, and had slept aboard.</p>

<p>“Pretty late for breakfast, ain’t it?” demanded
Herb as they began to gather around while
Josh started to divide the contents of the two
fryingpans between them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! call it a warm lunch if you like,” sang
out Buster, who was feeling fine; “I began to
think when nobody seemed to stir, that our next
meal would be supper. So, as that was too
much, I just determined I’d show you all that
I could be progressive for once, and I started
this bully meal agoing, didn’t I, Josh?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Buster, so you did,” nodded the
one addressed, who was also in an unusually
good humor, after the lively events of the preceding
night. “But what are you alookin’ at
me like that for, Jack?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you felt like taking a
little run with me, that’s all,” came the reply
from the Commodore.</p>

<p>“In the Tramp, d’ye mean?” queried Josh,
eagerly, for it struck him that Jack had honored
him highly in thus deliberately picking him out
when there four other fellows present.</p>

<p>“Yes. We may be gone the balance of the
afternoon, but will surely get back before night
sets in,” the other went on to say.</p>

<p>“What’s all this mystery mean, I want to
know?” demanded George, pretending to look
hurt; though he would not have cared to be a
passenger on any other craft besides his precious
if tricky Wireless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Jimmy broke in, “tell us about it,
that’s a good boy, Jack!”</p>

<p>“Well, listen and I will,” the other started
in to say; “you must remember that we’ve got a
pretty hefty bunch of money along with us right
now; and for one I won’t feel easy so long as
it’s in our charge.”</p>

<p>“Whew! that’s a fact!” ejaculated Buster.</p>

<p>“P’raps there’s all the stuff they hooked from
that bank in the bag you tied up with that heavy
cord, Jack,” suggested Herb.</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” agreed the Commodore,
“all but the twenty I took out to hand over to
those two loggers to pay for their burnt cabin,
and the help they gave us. But just stop and
think what a terrible condition all the good
people of Lawrence must be in right now, will
you? I reckon half those in the town will feel
the pinch of the broken bank, one way or
another.”</p>

<p>“Correct you are, Jack; because in all these
towns the bank is supported by business men,
widows with money to invest, and even laboring
men deposit their little savings. You ought to
know, Jack, because banking runs in your
family,” and George nodded, as though he wanted
every one to see that he was in full agreement
with the other in all he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, to relieve their minds, and give them
the first decent night’s sleep they’ve had up to
now since the bank was broken open,” continued
Jack, “I want to take Josh here, and run
down river a ways to that town we noticed the
light of when we were shooting past in the night.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see,” remarked Buster, with what was
a wonderfully quick perception, for him, “mebbe
now you mean to wire on about it all, Jack.”</p>

<p>“I expect to send a dispatch, telling them that
the plunder has been recovered, and is coming
back by express as fast as we can get it there;
the full particulars will have to keep until the
Motor Boat Boys get back from their little cruise
down the Mississippi.”</p>

<p>“And of course the news will float over to our
little borough, in the natural course of events,”
suggested George, proudly.</p>

<p>“I c’n just see the good people waitin’ to
receive us with the brass band, and all the town
run wild over the doings of the wonderful
heroes of the old Mississippi!” cried Buster,
waving his fork above his head excitedly, as he
pictured the stirring scene in his mind’s eye.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly that,” said Jack, quietly, for
he disliked all such exhibitions exceedingly;
“because we won’t let anybody know just when
we expect to strike town again. In fact, if I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
fix it up that way we’ll be apt to arrive after
sunset.”</p>

<p>“You mean sneak in like a dog with his tail
between his legs?” complained George. “That’s
too bad, Jack. If we’d done anything we ought
to be ashamed of it might go; but when a bunch
of valiant lads carry on like we have, and not
only chases the bank thieves to a successful
finish, but manages to recover the stolen stuff,
seems to me we’d only be getting our due if we
let our admiring fellow townsmen make a little
ado over us. You’re too modest, Jack, and
that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can settle all that later on,” laughed
the other, as he arose; “if you’ve had all you
want to eat, Josh, suppose we get ready to take
our little run.”</p>

<p>“Weather looks O. K. out there, for one
thing,” observed Buster, as he scanned the
serene surface of the mighty river, which of
course was not to be compared with what the
boys had seen hundreds of miles further down
on their trip to New Orleans, though wide
enough even at that.</p>

<p>“Little that would matter to a couple of well
seasoned old tars like me’n Jack!” declared Josh
grandly.</p>

<p>Going into the tent Jack speedily reappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
bearing the wonderful little bag which they had
so cleverly forced the thieves to drop on the
preceding night, when that lively fracas occurred
on the floating raft out upon the river.</p>

<p>Josh was already aboard the Tramp, and
grinning for all he was worth, such was his
satisfaction over having been chosen by the
Commodore as his companion in this very important
mission.</p>

<p>“Do we take the Marlin along with us, Jack?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“What for? Better leave it here for the boys
to use if anything comes along,” was the reply
he received, as Jack clambered aboard.</p>

<p>“Oh! just as you say,” remarked Josh, half
reluctantly, as he handed the gun over to Andy.
“Only I thought, you see, that we might happen
to run across them precious rascals again, and
if they tried to board us, we’d want something
along to stand ’em off with.”</p>

<p>George laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“Listen to Josh, would you?” he cried. “He’s
sure going to dream of those two bad men for
a whole month of Sundays. Why, they turned
out to be kind of chicken-hearted after all.
They gave up the bag as easy as you please,
when Jack told ’em he’d send the second charge
around their legs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“And swim!” echoed Andy. “I niver saw annything
to equal the loikes in all me loife. They
was crazy to ra’ch the shore, so they was.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but for all that they hated to lose the
plunder after the trouble they’d been put to,”
continued Josh, not wholly convinced; “and if
the chance came along to make another try for
that bag, believe me, they’d grab on to it. But
just as Jack says, it goes; and I reckon the little
Tramp can show ’em a clean pair of heels if it
comes to a run?”</p>

<p>“Why, man alive, they wouldn’t have any
boat, because you remember they abandoned the
one they had, and we’ve fetched it along with
us, to discover who owns the same, because
we believe it must have been stolen,” Herb
ventured to say.</p>

<p>There were few preparations to look after,
for Jack always made it a point to have his boat
in good running order, so that none of the boys
could really remember when it had ever gone
back on its owner.</p>

<p>Of course he first of all made sure that there
was plenty of “juice” in his tank; each of the
boats carried an additional supply of gasoline
aboard, in case of necessity, for they had figured
out the trip systematically, and knew to a fraction
of a gallon what quantity they would need,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
so that it had been easy to prepare for extra
occasions by making a very generous allowance.</p>

<p>“Goodbye, and good luck!” called Buster, as
he waved his hand after the starting Tramp.</p>

<p>“Somebody look out for supper, because you
just can’t depend on me always!” Josh sent
back.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s all right, Josh,” replied the fat
chum, contentedly; “there are three other fellers
in this crowd, and I reckon I’ve done my part
of the cooking stunt for one day.”</p>

<p>The gallant little motor boat was soon moving
along with the current of the river, and keeping
rather in toward the west shore; because it had
been in that quarter Jack remembered seeing
the lights of some sort of town while chasing
after the bank thieves on the preceding night.</p>

<p>“How long ought it to take us to get there,
d’ye think?” asked Josh, as he made himself
quite comfortable.</p>

<p>“It might be an hour and a half, and again
we may be all of two hours making port,”
answered the skipper of the Tramp, as he busied
himself with the reliable little motor that as
yet had never failed him in an emergency.</p>

<p>“If the river was straight we might even now
glimpse the town with our glasses,” suggested
Josh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>As the minutes flew past the two chums enjoyed
themselves as boys naturally would under
similar circumstances; especially after having
passed through such a series of exciting happenings
as Jack and his comrades had.</p>

<p>They reviewed the entire programme, and
Josh declared that he would never forget the
sight of that ramshackle cabin on the raft of
logs, burning so furiously, while he and the rest
were almost holding their breath with impatience,
as they waited for the two yeggmen to
dash out after the heat inside had become
unbearable.</p>

<p>“There’s the place we’re making for!” cried
out Josh, suddenly, as they began to pass a
point of land that jutted far out into the river.</p>

<p>“Just about where I reckoned it was,” returned
Jack; “and we’ll make a landing in about
half an hour at most.”</p>

<p>He proved to be a true prophet, for in less
time than that the bustling little motor boat
drew in toward the shore, because they were
now opposite the town.</p>

<p>A heavy freight train was rumbling along in
plain sight, headed north, Jack happened to
notice; and slowing up while passing through
the small river town.</p>

<p>“I’m glad that the railroad runs past here,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he told Josh, as they headed for a little landing
belonging to what seemed to be a boat-builder’s
establishment, for some such place is to be
found at nearly every town bordering the big
rivers of the West.</p>

<p>“What for?” asked the other, preparing to
fend off, so that they would not strike too hard.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know, we want to make use
of the express company and the telegraph line
the worst kind just now; and the railroad tells
us we’re going to find both here waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” muttered Josh, wondering
how it was Jack always thought of everything.</p>

<p>The owner of the river boatyard now approached,
and Jack soon made arrangements
with him to leave the Tramp in his charge while
they were gone.</p>

<p>Buster had found out that the provisions
were already running low in several particulars,
perhaps on account of the savage appetites
several members of the party had shown, who
in times past had not been heavy eaters.</p>

<p>And to please the fat voyager the Commodore
had promised to pick up a few tasty things.
As their little Easter cruise had turned out to
be such a “howling success” as George called
it, they could afford to celebrate with a feast or
two. Buster was great on suggesting reasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
for indulging in some unusual spread; but in
this instance everybody had agreed with him
that they really had a good reason for doing
the same.</p>

<p>Picking up the little bag, which the river man
glanced at casually, never dreaming that it held
thousands and thousands of dollars in bills and
specie, Jack started up the bank.</p>

<p>He had already asked a few questions of the
man, and had his bearings all right. There
was an express and telegraph office all in one,
and once they reached this, at the railroad
station, their troubles would be over.</p>

<p>Jack expected to take ample precautions so
as to make sure that the bag would get to its
destination without being tampered with. He
had figured all this out in that active mind of
his, and even explained the particulars to his
companion, who pronounced the scheme first-class.</p>

<p>Josh was plodding along ahead of his mate
when all of a sudden he felt Jack pluck him by
the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Wait up a minute, Josh, can’t you?” declared
the other; “I’m carrying something of a
load, you must remember, and this is a pretty steep
grade up to the railroad tracks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! excuse me, Jack,” said Josh, falling in
step with the other.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he heard Jack say in a low, tense
tone; “perhaps we’re going to have some more
trouble about this bag after all!”</p>

<p>“Oh! thunder! what do you mean now?”
demanded Josh, astounded.</p>

<p>“Here, none of that!” said Jack. “Don’t
look so startled, but laugh, just as if I might be
telling you a good joke. There, that’s more
like it, though I reckon your laugh was half
frozen before it got out. Now, pay attention
to me!”</p>

<p>“Sure I am, Jack; go right along and tell me
what’s up.”</p>

<p>“There are two men watching us come up this
bank right now,” Jack went on to say. “We’ve
made a turn so it wouldn’t be easy for us to
chase back to the boat again. I’ve got a notion,
Josh, they’re the very rascals we made give up
this bag of boodle last night!”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Jack? However could they
get up here; because it was far down the river
we left that pair swimming like ducks?”</p>

<p>“Well, I half remember seeing somebody drop
off that same slow freight as it ran through;
and yeggs like to travel like tramps, you know,”
and Jack pointed out upon the river, as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he might be explaining something to his friend.</p>

<p>“Oh! mebbe they were just stealing a ride on
the bumpers, and happened to see us acomin’
in to the shore,” suggested Josh. “Yes, of
course they’d be apt to guess what fetched us
here, and when they glimpsed that precious bag
in your hand they knew. But Jack, what can
we do? Oh! why didn’t you let me carry our
Marlin with us? You see what a valuable thing
it’d be right here and now?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would have been better,” admitted
the other; “but no use crying over spilt milk,
Josh. We must figure out how we can give
them the slip; and I think I see a good chance
right now.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me, because I want to know,”
pleaded the other, eagerly.</p>

<p>“They’re hiding behind that pile of old ties,”
said Jack; “and if we kept straight on as we
expected to do we’d strike the railroad track
just about there.”</p>

<p>“But now you won’t, will you, Jack?”</p>

<p>“We’ll walk on a few steps, as though we
hadn’t changed our minds a bit,” Jack told him.
“But as soon as we strike where the bank hides
us from their eyes we’ll turn sharply to the
right, and scuttle along as fast as we can make
it. By the time we have to show up again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
we’ll have put some little distance between the
men and ourselves; and then we’ll make a push
for it as fast as our legs will carry us.”</p>

<p>“Bully idea, Jack; and it’s just bound to
work too; only I do wish you’d gone and let me
lug that gun along. Oh! what wouldn’t I give
right now for a chance to fill the legs of the
slick yeggs full of bird shot!”</p>

<p>Josh was hurrying after his chum while
talking in this strain. Upon arriving at the
spot where, as Jack had said, they would no
longer have the friendly shelter of the bank,
the two lads suddenly started off on a full run,
heading direct for the town close at hand;
indeed, already they were among the scattering
outlying houses of the same.</p>

<p>A loud series of hoarse shouts from down the
track told that the pair of yeggmen had caught
sight of them.</p>

<p>Josh, casting one fearful glance over his
shoulder, discovered them in full pursuit.</p>

<p>He even bent down and snatched up an occasional
piece of rock or scrap iron, as though
determined to fight to the last in case of being
overtaken.</p>

<p>But Josh was a fast runner, and Jack himself
had few equals in his home school. They certainly
had plenty of reasons for doing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
level best when they found themselves pursued
so hotly by that pair of lawless tramp burglars.</p>

<p>As usual Jack had his eyes about him, and was
noting the lay of the land. When any one
makes good use of all his faculties, as this boy
generally did, he is apt to take advantage of
openings that would never occur to most fellows.</p>

<p>“This way, Josh!” Jack flung over his shoulder,
for he was still doing the leading, though the
long-legged one might easily have gone ahead
had he wished, weighted down as Jack was by
the heavy bag.</p>

<p>With every jump they made they were pushing
further and further into the centre of the
little river town.</p>

<p>Women came to the doors to see them running,
attracted by the angry shouts of the men;
who, having succeeded in coming up closer to
those they chased were hoping to frighten them
with threats, so that they would drop the bag.</p>

<p>Children, too, scattered like chickens at the
swoop of a plunging motorcycle; and huddled at
the sides of the street, gazing wide-eyed at the
running boys and pursuing men.</p>

<p>“Bang!”</p>

<p>Apparently one of the desperate yeggs had
managed to keep his revolver in serviceable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
condition, in spite of his submersion in the chilly
waters of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>“Not hurt, I hope, Josh?” cried Jack, over
his shoulder, as he still kept running wildly.</p>

<p>“Nixey, not!” gasped the other; “but I’m
adoin’ all I can to shield you, Jack!”</p>

<p>Which he really was; and in that moment
Jack saw further into the generous soul of the
tall comrade than fortune had ever allowed him
to do before.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be all right, because there’s
a policeman running out of that house ahead.
It must be police headquarters, because I see
another coming. Keep going just a minute
more, Josh!”</p>

<p>“Whoo! good for a whole hour yet!” exploded
the other, defiantly.</p>

<p>Before half the minute was up Jack gave an
exclamation of satisfaction; at the same time he
slackened his pace.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this to take a backward peep,
Josh discovered that the two yeggs had not
only stopped their hot pursuit, but were actually
running the other way. Men of their stripe
never do like the sight of blue uniforms and
brass buttons.</p>

<p>Of course Jack had a surprising story to tell
the two policemen. He did not take the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to explain everything, save that he and his
friend had been fortunate enough to recover
some valuables taken from the bank of an up-river
town, and that there would surely be a
nice fat reward offered for the apprehension of
the precious pair who were even then in plain
sight, making off.</p>

<p>This was enough to excite everybody; and
presently the policemen, as well as a posse of
eager private citizens had started on the run
after the fleeing pair.</p>

<p>Josh gripped the hand of his chum.</p>

<p>“Another close call, Jack, let me tell you;
but the same old Stormways luck held good,
and we came out of the big end of the horn.
And now I reckon it’s us to the station to get
this stuff off our hands, and a receipt for the
same; as well as to send that cheering message
to Lawrence.”</p>

<p>They soon made all arrangements. The agent
at the station proved to be a middle-aged and
sensible man, who was deeply interested in as
much of their story as the boys chose to tell
him. He did the bag up good and strong, and
sealed the same, so that it could not be tampered
with except at the company’s risk.</p>

<p>Then, after sending a message, “collect,”
which bore the good news to the mayor of Lawrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and to which he signed all six names, his
own last of all, Jack was ready to do his little
marketing, and start back to the island; which,
in due time, they reached in good shape.</p>

<p>Of course the boys had a glorious time of it
during the balance of the week. Buster, happy
in the recovery of his sweater, was the life of the
crowd, and caught many a fine fish, for he was
at it early and late.</p>

<p>They figured that it must have been that the
two thieves, remembering they had secured no
paint with which to change their white boat to
one of darker hue, had stopped off at the next
town, and entered the boat builder’s place in
order to pick up the necessary material; and
seeing the sweater, as the night air was chilly,
the big man had put it on. The other white
boat was claimed by a party thirty miles above
Lawrence, who proved that it had been stolen
three days before the robbery of the bank.</p>

<p>Jack, on running across the little mound
where the box planted by Algernon still lay, for
the boys had insisted on burying it again, asked
Herb about it, and from him learned that the
small dog had been a pet of the Saunterer’s
skipper, that had taken a fit, and died on the
trip, which accounted for the strange burial.</p>

<p>And when finally their outing came to an end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and the motor boat boys reached home, they
found that once again they were being spoken
of as heroes. Why, all Lawrence united to do
them honor; and besides a fine reward that it
was insisted they should accept for their gallant
deed, there was a document worthy of being
framed, and hung in the club room, signed by
the president and directors of the bank, thanking
them most heartily in the names of all the
depositors and officers of the institution, many
of whom would have lost their all had the valuables
not been recovered.</p>

<p>And after that all banks around that section
of the Mississippi Valley began to take notice,
and make preparations against raids by gangs
of daring yeggmen; so that the lesson was going
to prove of great value to the community.</p>

<p>Of course we shall hope and expect to meet
Jack, George, Josh, Andy, Herb, and last but
far from least, genial Buster, again before a
great while; when possibly they will be starting
out once more on some adventurous trip that
would deserve being written up. Until that
time let it be only goodnight, and not good-bye.</p>
